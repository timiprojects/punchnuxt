Models, an agency where &#8216;everybody&#8217; is a model"},content:{rendered:"<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>&#8220;What makes a good ugly model is someone who is comfortable in his own skin&#8221;</strong></p>\n<p>Long necks, large chins, flapping ears, crooked noses: welcome to Ugly Models, a London modelling agency of a different stripe, where imperfections are celebrated.</p>\n<p>Fashion Week opens in the British capital Friday, and among the legions of models strutting down the catwalk, several will come from Ugly.</p>\n<p>They make eye-catching additions to the perfectly honed or androgynous models that typically feature at fashion&#8217;s annual showcase in London.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s celebrating diversity really and it&#8217;s bringing a bit more light to fashion instead of just using the bog-standard models,&#8221; agency owner Marc French told AFP.</p>\n<p>He describes it as a &#8220;character&#8221; model agency &#8212; &#8220;from fat, thin, to large to small: you name it, we&#8217;ve got it&#8221;.</p>\n<p>He cited the example of French actor Gerard Depardieu.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I mean look at him: he&#8217;s so full of character and charisma.</p>\n<p>&#8220;He becomes sexy because he&#8217;s so cool and he&#8217;s so different.&#8221;</p>\n<h2>&#8211; &#8216;Imperfection is beauty&#8217; &#8211;</h2>\n<p>Founded a half century ago, Ugly occupies trendy open-plan space in west London featuring a baroque sofa, brushed aluminium computers and walls studded with photos of models.</p>\n<p>A portrait of late rock superstar David Bowie adorns the wall, alongside the quote &#8220;Imperfection is beauty, madness is genius,&#8221; which reads like a company motto.</p>\n<p>Like any such agency, it manages the careers of its models, putting them in touch with employers of all stripes, from Burberry to Mercedes to Jack Daniel&#8217;s.</p>\n<p>On a recent weekday, Ugly was organising a casting to complete its catalogue and those in attendance were atypical models.</p>\n<p>Among them were some tough-looking guys.</p>\n<p>Chris, for example, a former soldier with arms as thick as logs, posed shirtless with a 50-year-old brunette in a two-piece suit.</p>\n<p>Kris Chesney, an ex-rugby player with Toulon and Saracens, is a man mountain at nearly two metres (over six feet) tall and weighing 135 kilogrammes (almost 300 pounds).</p>\n<p>With his shaved head, tattooed arms, rugged face, and body bearing the marks of countless scrums, he is perhaps an unlikely male model.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a new journey, something interesting, like a challenge,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>Others are on more of a personal mission.</p>\n<p>Sheerah Ravindren, a petite 22-year-old model just 1.61 metres tall, comes from Sri Lanka and proclaims herself a &#8220;militant immigrant model&#8221;.</p>\n<p>Sporting a bare belly between baggy jeans and black top, she has a right nostril piercing and plenty of positive attitude.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m a woman of colour. Growing up, I&#8217;ve never seen people that look like me in media, in fashion.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Frances, a disabled model who gets around using a pair of eye-catchingly futuristic crutches, revealed proudly that her disability &#8220;didn&#8217;t stop me from doing what I want&#8221;.</p>\n<h2>&#8211; &#8216;Not here to exploit&#8217; &#8211;</h2>\n<p>For French, &#8220;what makes a good ugly model is someone who is comfortable in his own skin&#8221;.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t want retouching, we don&#8217;t want people to change the way they look.</p>\n<p>&#8220;If someone comes to us a certain way, we&#8217;d never say it&#8217;d be better if he was smaller.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s really important. There&#8217;s so much pressure on young kids,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>The agency is also eager to counter any perception that it cynically exploits its models for their peculiarities.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Sometimes we&#8217;ve had companies ring up and said: we want a small person that will kick themselves in the head. Woo&#8230; like no &#8212; that&#8217;s wrong,&#8221; said Lulu Palmer, a booker who is head of new faces.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re not here to exploit people, to take the mickey out of people.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Always on the lookout for new talent, the team admitted the company name can elicit less than enthusiastic responses from would-be models.</p>\n<p>But, said French, &#8220;the minute they understand what Ugly is all about then they want to be a model.&#8221;</p>\n<p>AFP.</p>\n"},excerpt:{rendered:"<p>&nbsp; &#8220;What makes a good ugly model is someone who is comfortable in his own skin&#8221; Long necks, large chins, flapping ears, crooked noses: welcome to Ugly Models, a London modelling agency of a different stripe, where imperfections are celebrated.

This is beyond a movie. This is huge,&#8221; said Brian Barasa, a 29-year-old Kenyan who says he has loved comic books for as long as he can remember.</p>\n<p>Set in the fictional African country of Wakanda, the film&#8217;s focus on black protagonists, stories and culture sets it clearly apart from other superhero movies.</p>\n<p>But hero T&#8217;Challa, the king of Wakanda played by Chadwick Boseman, is not the first black superhero to hit the big screen.</p>\n<p>Barasa, who co-founded the Nairobi Comic Convention in 2014, points out that was &#8220;Blade&#8221; &#8212; a vampire with human traits portrayed by actor Wesley Snipes in the trilogy between 1998 and 2004.</p>\n<p>&#8220;But Blade was American,&#8221; said Barasa.</p>\n<p>&#8220;In a conversation I had recently, somebody pointed out, &#8216;Blade had to walk in order for Black Panther to run&#8217;,&#8221; he noted.</p>\n<h2>&#8211; Cultural impact &#8211;</h2>\n<p>So far &#8220;Black Panther&#8221; has generated an enthusiastic response from communities in Kenya and Nigeria that are often stereotypically represented on screen.</p>\n<p>Superhero fans also appear to appreciate the film&#8217;s visual qualities, the reproduction of costumes from the original comic and the characters&#8217; accents.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Usually in Hollywood, you&#8217;re just African. They will use a Nigerian actor with a Nigerian accent to play a Kenyan character or vice versa,&#8221; said Sope Aluko, one of five Nigerians in the film, at the Lagos premiere in Nigeria this week.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We knew that we had a responsibility towards Africa and the black community in general while shooting this movie,&#8221; she added. &#8220;But I didn&#8217;t expect anything like this, all this enthusiasm coming from the black community.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Commercially, the film looks set to break some box office records.</p>\n<p>But for some, the potential cultural impact could be its most important achievement.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a very important statement to the world that Marvel Studio can have a movie entirely based on African characters,&#8221; said Kenyan actor Moses Odua at the African premiere in Kisumu, a town in the west of the country.</p>\n<p>&#8220;That is so nice, it&#8217;s going to turn away some of the stereotypes we have on Africans.&#8221;</p>\n<h2>&#8211; &#8216;Afro-future&#8217; &#8211;</h2>\n<p>In the film, Wakanda has skilfully exploited its mineral wealth to become the most developed and technologically advanced country in the world &#8212; a complete reverse of the run-of-mill portrayal of African nations as backward, poverty-stricken and disease-ridden.</p>\n<p>Yet, at the same time, Wakanda is also anchored in African values of community and spirit.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I like the Afro-future description of the continent and the mix of modern and tradition. They show regular Africans working with technology,&#8221; said Chiko Esire, 32, in Lagos.</p>\n<p>Others took pride in the purely commercial aspect of &#8220;Black Panther&#8221;, which has already beaten &#8220;The Hunger Games&#8221; and &#8220;Beauty and the Beast&#8221; in pre-sales in the United States.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not a movie fanatic, I only watch maybe three or four movies a year,&#8221; said 27-year-old James Odede, who runs an IT firm.</p>\n<p>&#8220;But I am excited about this one because it tries to illustrate that a movie that is predominantly black-cast can still sell and do well.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Kenya film-maker Jinna Mutune, 29, believes the film has achieved its aim of showing African culture in a positive light but that more black-focused movies need to be produced.</p>\n<p>&#8220;(It) is definitely filling a huge gap,&#8221; she said, but added: &#8220;We need more and more and more &#8216;Black Panthers&#8217;.&#8221;</p>\n<p>AFP.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n'},excerpt:{rendered:"<p>The release this week of Marvel Studios&#8217; latest superhero outing, &#8220;Black Panther&#8221;, has triggered the enthusiasm of African movie fans and a sense of pride that Hollywood has finally plugged a gap.

The song, titled <em>Can You Feel it, </em>has become one of the four singles that the pretty Rose now has to her credit.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">While she released her first two singles — <em>All of This is You</em> and <em>Love me Right</em> — in 2016, <em>Take Your Time</em> is her latest, released after <em>Can You Feel</em> it in 2017. Now, Rose is in Nigeria to, according to her, experience the musical environment and strengthen her art with African sounds. She is in Lagos with her Ogere Remo, Ogun State-born father, George Alaba, who, interestingly, has been a DJ and a recording artiste, too.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The Alaba senior used to work at Lagos-based Tabansi Records. He is a contemporary of the likes of Christ Okotie, Felix Liberty and Majek Fashek.  In 1984, he moved to Austria, where he met his Filipino wife, Gina, mother of David and Rose May. Although George went as far as recording some albums and made good impact in Austria, he has ‘been retired’ by the family who maintain that all they need to do now is to support the new generation represented by Rose May.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Yet, like a river that still adores its source, Rose May says her family are her primary source of inspiration. Although her mother may not have waxed any record, she is also a singer. As a child, she — Rose May — loved to play football, and she found a trainer in her brother, David, who had, since childhood, shown great tendency for the round leather game. As time went on, however, it became clear that Rose’s musical talent was more compelling.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">By age six and seven, she sang often. By eight, the father enrolled her in a piano school and this has helped her a lot. While Rose May has also taken advantage of <em>YouTube</em> to train herself on other areas of music, she also studied acting, although she has not done much acting beyond some musicals she participated in.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">“I have been doing music all my life,” she says. “By age 13, I began to write my own songs. But it was three years ago that I started music professionally.”</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The singer is proud of what she has done so far — especially her singles and major performances. But she aims by far higher than she has done in her career.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">She says, “I try to find and nurture my own sound. I am not where I want to be yet; so, I am determined to work harder. I really love African music. My fans in Austria listen to African music as it is a big thing.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">“I was born and raised in Austria, but I am proud to be home and back to my roots. I want to work with the producers and songwriters I have been listening to. I am home because I want my music to have African influence.”</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">On the challenges she is facing as a musician, she says there is sometimes a lot of pressure on an artiste. According to her, it is not everyone that is ready to patiently and genuinely work with the artiste towards success.  Her belief is that some just come around for the quick money they think they can get.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">She adds, “The social media is also a factor here. It wants to give you a picture of what should be. But you want to satisfy people without compromising who you want to be.”</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Rose May is reluctant to give names yet, but she already has a list of Nigerian music makers she wants to professionally romance.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">”<strong>Copyright PUNCH.</strong><strong><br />\n</strong><em>All rights reserved.

It is coming as a Valentine bonus for music lovers.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Speaking on his preparedness for the treat, Gold said he valued the interaction he would, again, have with his fans. According to him, he is prepared to give them the best.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">He said,  “This is not like every other show because we are going to have fun. It’s going to be an amazing night.  I’ve heard many people complain of not getting live concerts. To be honest, it’s not fair that I have a song on my phone. I’ve listened to it. Now, you have a show and I’m listening to the song in the car before I get to your show and then you now come on stage to sing the same thing.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">“People are beginning to ask for more. I think people are ready for live music. People now attend live music events. They attended my show and it was at a time other artistes had concerts. I think we are ready for live shows,” he declared.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Interestingly, the concert will bring Gold and Simi together again. But more than the usual relationship question that arises when the two are being discussed, Simi, too, is thinking highly about the event.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Her words, “To be honest, anything you haven’t already seen in the public, it’s probably stuff I’m keeping it to myself. But if you are talking about performance, I mean every single thing you do, the more you do it, the better you get better at it. I think I’ve grown as a performer over the years because, starting out, I was more of a recording artiste. Now, I’m really excited to go on stage and play with my band and give people excitement of their lives,” he enthused.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"> “You can recreate something that is already existing. My band, for example, when we are making a song, we can change the arrangement of the guitars or the drums; we can make something that is <em>slow faster</em> and something <em>faster slower</em>. You can do something entirely different; you don’t know what you are going to hear next. You know the song, but you don’t know the form you are going to hear it. That’s why I prefer live music because you can do anything you like with it; yet, it’s still the same material.”</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">”<strong>Copyright PUNCH.</strong><strong><br />\n</strong><em>All rights reserved.

Suraj Adekunbi, also described the former VC as an icon and a role model.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">In his speech, Adeyemi not only established why the association decided to host Bello, he also set the tone for the story of emancipation that echoed throughout the programme.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">According to him, it was an occasion to celebrate excellence, enrich history, renew  the present and chart a great new course for the future as far as Yewaland was concerned.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">He said, “We are very happy that with Prof. Rahman Bello, shame is not the lot of Yewaland. Rather, he has done us proud and he has shown to the world the great potential in  every nook and cranny of our dear vast but yet untapped mini world – Yewaland, I mean. “It is for this reason that the Yewaland Development Forum decided to organise this and invite you all, and we are very grateful that you have made it a day.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">“You would agree with me that in the scheme of things in our beloved state,  Yewaland has yet to assert itself. We have not got the opportunity to contribute meaningfully enough, nor have we also been able to make enough concerted efforts to do so. Yet, we are a legitimate and bonafide part and parcel of Ogun Sate. We are not a conquered territory and neither are we an inferior breed. When we, thus, regularly come together like this, we will have the opportunity to reflect on where the rain began to beat us, as legendary writer, Chinua Achebe,  would say. We will be able to approach the future with the hope  for self and mutual fulfilment.”</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">In his lecture titled, Ogun State Project: Stemming the Erosions of Economic and Political Agitations of the Underdeveloped West District, Senitor Kolawole Bajomo gave a historical perspective of the state’s politics and the intrigues that, according to him, often get Ogun West marginalised. He appealed to the other political zones and challenged Yewa people to harness their resources to get themselves out of deprivation.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">He said, “As democrats, we hold as inviolable principle that the marginalisation of a section of the people in the nation or the state such as we are witnessing today should not be allowed to continue since it has the potential to result in a systematic and comprehensive denial of the human rights of the people which our government swore to protect by the constitution.”</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">It was an elated Bello who, alongside his wife, who appreciated the gestures of the stakeholders.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">He said, “I didn’t expect what has been happening to me since two months ago. A total of eight receptions have, so far, been organised for me, for which I thank the organisers. While I believe that there is none that is not worth it, the greatest honour is the one from one’s people. Today’s is thus very symbolic because it is from my own people.”</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Bello said that although he returned to the university after serving as a commissioner in Ogun State, he had never left Yewa people, body and soul. According to him, the Yewa agenda is one he has been talking about for long.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">He added, “The challenge as far as the Yewa agenda is concerned is that of unity, resources and patronage. There will never be a time that political differences will not be there. But, even if there are several aspirants, we must know when it is time to harmonise and time to give up personal aspirations for the collective one. We must face 2019 with the biggest resolute.”</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Copyright PUNCH.</strong><strong><br />\n</strong><em>All rights reserved.

royalties: MCSN floors COSON in court"},content:{rendered:'<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Oladimeji Ramon</strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The Federal High Court in Lagos on Tuesday upheld the power of the Musical Copyright Society of Nigeria Limited to operate as a Collective Management Organisation for the management of royalties on behalf of Nigerian musicians.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Justice Ibrahim Buba, in his judgment, dismissed the suit filed by the Chief Tony Okoroji-led Copyright Society of Nigeria, challenging the power of the MCSN to operate as a CMO.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">COSON had urged the court to declare as invalid the approval given to the MCSN by the Nigerian Copyright Commission to operate as a CMO.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">It urged the court to invalidate the Attorney General of the Federation’s directive to the NCC to approve the MCSN as a CMO.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The defendants in the suit were MCSN, NCC and the AGF, Mr. Abubakar Malami (SAN).</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The court resolved all the issues raised in the suit against COSON in favour of the MCSN.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Justice Buba rejected COSON’s request for a declaration that “the purported approval to operate as a collective management organisation for music (musical work) and sound recordings granted the 1st defendant (MCSN) by the 2nd defendant (COSON) pursuant to a directive of the 3rd defendant (AGF) is void ab initio and of no effect whatsoever.”</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The court also declined the prayer to declare as null and void “all acts done by the 1st defendant pursuant to the purported approval of the 1st defendant received from the 2nd defendant to operate as a collective management organisation for music (musical works) and sound recording.”</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">COSON had, in the suit, contended that by virtue of Section 39(3) of the Copyright Act, Cap C28, Laws of the Federation of Nigeria 2004, NCC could not validly grant the MCSN an approval to operate as a CMO on behalf of the same artistes being represented by COSON.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">COSON contended that NCC could only have validly granted an approval to the MCSN to represent the artistes or copyright owners if it could prove that COSON was not already representing them well.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">COSON contended that the NCC and the AGF did not give it the opportunity to be heard before coming to the conclusion that the copyright owners were not being already adequately represented by COSON.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">It urged the court to decide whether it was appropriate for the NCC to approve the MCSN as a CMO, “when the MCSN and several of its officers are facing seven criminal cases filed by the same NCC.”</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">It also contended that, by virtue of Section 51 of the Copyright Act, Cap C28, LFN 2004, the AGF could not lawfully direct the NCC to withdraw the criminal charges it filed against MCSN and its officers.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">In his judgment, however, Justice Buba held that the AGF reserved the discretion to direct the NCC to terminate the criminal charges.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">But the judge berated MCSN’s lawyer, Mr. Romeo Michael, for the petition written by his client accusing the judge of bias.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The judge vowed to report Michael to the Nigerian Bar Association’s Legal Practitioners’ Disciplinary Committee for unethical and unprofessional conduct.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Earlier on Tuesday, Michael had informed the judge that his client had filed an application seeking to stop the delivery of the judgment for fear of bias.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">He had urged the judge to recuse himself from the case because his clients lacked confidence in the judge.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">But the judge promptly dismissed the application, describing it as a ploy to arrest the judgment, which was due for delivery.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Reacting to the judgment, the Chairman of MCSN, Orits Wiliki, said, “We are overjoyed. We knew that success will definitely come. We’ve been on this journey for 25 years and we know that the truth, even if it is subdued, will definitely emerge.”</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">But COSON’s Chairman, Okoroji, hinted that he would proceed on appeal.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Copyright PUNCH.</strong><strong><br />\n</strong><em>All rights reserved.

This is not about going to a club and dancing your time away, it is about sitting down to learn something that you can take away. Something that can inspire your life, that will inspire you to contribute your own quota to the new Nigeria that we are all aspiring for; a Nigeria where corruption is no longer an issue, a Nigeria where I can look at the governance of the country and be happy and content; a Nigeria where everyone has equality that guarantees justice and all that.

Telling <strong>Sunday Scoop</strong> about how he felt on that day, he said, “I had mixed feelings actually. I put in a lot of time in my daughter’s upbringing and we bonded so well. As a parent, you could sometime wish that your offspring would stay with you forever, but at a point, you have to let go. I am happy that I’m letting go to someone who is a gentleman, considerate and thoughtful. I wish her a happy married life. She has a good pedigree, and both the bride and groom’s parents have good marriages that have stood the test for time; that ought to count for something.”</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Describing the relationship he has with the daughter who got married, Adaeze, Charly Boy said, “I have a very unique relationship with all my children. They are not all treated the same because each kid is special in their unique ways. I don’t have one way of dealing with everybody. There are different strokes for different folks. I guess that’s the joy of parenting because not every kid would turn out the way you want him or her to. Some are late starters, while some are early birds.”</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Meanwhile, prior to the wedding, a picture of Charly Boy and his daughter was released and it promptly went viral. Speaking on the picture in which they both sat on a motorcycle, Charly said, “That picture was her idea. She asked me to do a photo shoot with her and the concept was centered around two people stranded on a desert. All my children have a bit of me in all of them and that’s only natural. I didn’t intentionally make it that way by conditioning their minds towards anything. I always tell my children to stay true to whom they really are, chase their dreams and be independent. I also tell them not to neglect the values and principles that we hold sacred in the Oputa family. I do whatever I want to do, and not what anybody tells me to. I expect that my children are going to be the same way. As long as it is a positive thing and it makes them happy, I would encourage them. I am their father and friend.”</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Copyright PUNCH.<br />\n</strong>All rights reserved.

There was a day I met her on the road and she asked me about what she had to do before she could join the choir. I explained things to her and she subsequently joined the choir. Over time, we became friends.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Was it love at first sight?</em></strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Saco:</strong> For me, I really cannot explain it because I sincerely liked her from the first day I set eyes on her. I just knew there was something different about her.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Aghogho: </strong>It wasn’t love at first sight for me. Gradually, I grew to like him.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>What qualities did you see in your spouse that convinced you he/she was the one?</em></strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Aghogho: </strong>My husband is very selfless and caring. He is also a very sincere and honest person, and those are qualities that I don’t joke with. That is what sealed the deal for me.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Saco:</strong> She is very homely and respectful. She is also passionate about God and I hold that very important.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>How did you propose to her?</em></strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Saco:</strong> We knew it was marriage we wanted before we even started dating and we had talked about it so well.  We had also agreed on the time that we would get married; so, when it was time, I gave her a ring in my car and she wore it with love.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>What was your reaction when he proposed?</em></strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Aghogho: </strong>There was no super reaction for me. Just like he said, we both knew the relationship was headed for marriage even before we started dating.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>How long have you been married?</em></strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Aghogho:</strong> Our marriage would be five years old in March.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>How would you describe your marriage experience so far?</em></strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Saco:</strong> It has really been an amazing experience for me. I’m still learning everyday to be a very good dad and a better husband.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Aghogho:</strong> Our marital experience has been beautiful, challenging and demanding but I thank God for everything. Overall, it has been a very wonderful experience.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Can you recall the first major disagreement you had as a married couple?</em></strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Saco:</strong> I sincerely cannot remember.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>How often do you quarrel?</em></strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Saco:</strong> To be honest with you, we really do not quarrel. I express my mind fully whenever I am hurt and the matter ends there. I don’t keep things inside me. I would rather settle whatever issue right there and move on.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Aghogho:</strong> It may be hard to believe but we sincerely do not quarrel. We are very open with each other and we understand ourselves. However, he usually pretends to be in a quiet mood when I decide to air my mind when I’m hurt.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Who usually apologises first when you quarrel?</em></strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Saco:</strong> I usually take the bold step. As the head of the house, it behooves the man to ensure that peace reigns at all times.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>How do you cope with your husband’s female admirers?</em></strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Aghogho:</strong> I know that there would always be admirers; so, I don’t let it bother me. We have sufficient trust in each other.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Why do you think celeb marriages don’t often last?</em></strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Aghogho:</strong> There are a lot of reasons for that. Sometimes, it could be as a result of the couple not understanding themselves. At other times, it could be because of lack of communication and dishonesty among other things. However, no two marriages are the same, and one must always apply wisdom in dealing with issues.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Do you keep a joint account, and would you advise couples to do same?</em></strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Saco:</strong> We do not keep a joint account but we have access to each other’s accounts.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>What pet names do you have for each other?</em></strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Saco:</strong> I call her ‘Ayomi’, and she calls me ‘Sweet’.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Do you usually buy gifts for each other?</em></strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Saco:</strong> Yes, we do.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Do you regularly go on dates?</em></strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Saco:</strong> Yes, we do.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>What other things do you do to keep the fire of your love burning?</em></strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Aghogho:</strong> We play together all the time. We also pray together, share thoughts and get really involved in each other’s lives.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>How do you unwind as a couple?</em></strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Saco:</strong> We watch movies, joke and run around the house together.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Can you recall the most memorable time of your marriage?</em></strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Saco: </strong>That would be when we had our daughter. It was such a beautiful moment and it is something I would never forget.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Aghogho:</strong> For me, the most memorable moment was when we were on our honeymoon. We really enjoyed ourselves because there were no other responsibilities at that period.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>What are some of the most important lessons you’ve learnt in marriage?</em></strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Saco:</strong> The power of agreement cannot be overstated. It is very essential for couples to be in agreement in everything that they do.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Aghogho:</strong> I have learnt that it is very important to be patient and to forgive. If you are patient, you would be able to think things through and you wouldn’t act in anger.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>What are the key ingredients needed to sustain a marriage?</em></strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Saco:</strong> God is the most important factor. When there’s God, there will be love and every other beautiful thing.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Does your husband partake in household chores?</em></strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Aghogho:</strong> Yes, he does. I give that to him. I think it is a good thing when couples share household chores because there are times that one person could be tired and might need help.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>What advice do you have for young couples?</em></strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Saco:</strong> Make sure you discuss everything between yourselves. Never allow side talks in your marriage because it always causes trouble. You should also be mindful of who you get advice from. Do not share the affairs of your home with friends or just anybody. Most importantly, get a marriage mentor. They would help to strengthen you and also give you advice from their own experience. Above all, put God first in everything you do.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Copyright PUNCH.</em><br />\n</strong>All rights reserved.

It was a near-death experience and I was in the vehicle with my management team. The accident was caused by an armed robbery. We were on the highway when suddenly the car was shot at. The driver was killed and we ended up in a ditch. I sustained injuries and the visible scars on my body are from that day.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">“I really thought it was the end, especially when the driver died and his foot was still on the throttle, making the car to continue moving. As the car was about to crash, I just covered my face and brace for impact. I thought that at least, one should die as a fine boy.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">“After the crash, the armed robbers came and ransacked all the bags in the car, looking for money. Today, I continue to remember that incident and I know that God kept me alive for a reason.”</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Copyright PUNCH.</em><br />\n</strong>All rights reserved.

She stated, “I believe that everybody is entitled to their opinions. Some people may say that they don’t like my dress, shoes or any other thing. I don’t find that surprising or strange because there are also a lot of dresses and shoes that I don’t like. I like to be comfortable in whatever I wear and that is what dictates my outfits.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">“A lot of people have expressed their views about my dress sense on social media. Sometimes, I ‘humour’ them. You can express yourself on my page but don’t be rude or insulting. Some of the people, who make those comments, are just full of hate and they just go all around the Internet, looking for where to spread their hate. I am comfortable in my own skin and I just want to keep making good music and connect with my true fans.”</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Recalling her experience of being the chief bridesmaid at her mother’s second wedding some weeks ago, Simi said, “It was a wonderful experience. Seeing my mother so happy was something I definitely enjoyed. I wish her and her husband best of luck in their marital journey.”</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Speaking on the success of her sophomore album, Simi, she said, “My last album, generated a lot of amazing responses and it really humbled me.

I want to be of help to my generation and that’s part of what informed my partnership with the Nigeria Police and other organisations. It is basically to correct some faulty notions that some people have about the police. Even though there may be some bad eggs, there are a lot of great and hard-working officers in the force.”</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Dismissing claims that he doesn’t pay attention to his studies, Bello said, “As a student, I tried my best to dedicate quality time to my studies. Even as an artiste with a very busy schedule, I made sure that my education does not suffer.”</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Describing the kind of relationship he has with his record label mates, Korede said, “The relationship I share with Reekado Banks, Di’ja and other members of Mavin is family-like. We share a great bond and we see ourselves as one. We look out for one another and pray for our collective and individual success.”</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Copyright PUNCH.<br />\n</strong>All rights reserved.

I had always wanted to visit the country, especially because I loved the culture, having watched several Bollywood movies and some Asian channels on cable TV.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>When did you travel to India?</em></strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">I travelled to India for the first time in May 2017. I was invited to speak at a conference and to receive an ‘Iconic Woman Award’ at the 2017 Annual Global Women Economic Forum in New Delhi.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Did you travel alone or you went with a group?</em></strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">I travelled alone. However, I met an amazing group of powerful women from around the world.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Do you recall some of the things that fascinated you when you arrived in India?</em></strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">I was fascinated by their exotic fashion, music, and women with different skin shades and hair types. I also saw a lot of good-looking men too. All of that became apparent from the moment  I stepped into the airport. I was also intrigued about how clean the airport was and the fact that there was free wireless Internet connection. Having Wifi in public places is not a big deal anywhere else in developed countries, but I was pleasantly surprised at how developed India was in terms of technology.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>How would you describe Indian culture and other things that clearly stand them out?</em></strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Their culture is very diverse; quite similar to Nigeria. Just like us, they are a multi-religious and multi-ethnic group of people who speak different languages. It was intriguing to see different tribes like the Gujarats, the Punjabis, the Bengalis and to discover how similar, yet diverse they all really are.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>What are some of the foods that tickled your taste buds while in India?</em></strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">I didn’t eat Nigerian food while there. I love non-vegetarian Indian food. Give me mutton or chicken tandoori and I’m good to go. I actually eat a lot of Indian food here in Nigeria; so, I felt right at home. I remember trying something like buns soaked in honey and it tasted like <em>puff-puff</em>. I loved waking up to drink Indian masala tea in the morning or even having it at noontime. I tried the pani-Pouri and different desserts.  I also remember trying the mango thick-shake.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>How receptive were the people towards you?</em></strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">They were very receptive. Everyone was polite, nice and they showed that they really loved me. Many of them said I was beautiful and I lost count of how many times I was referred to as a “tanned beauty.” I guess seeing a black person from Africa was exotic to them. I enjoyed being the foreigner, because I had good hosts who took adequate care of me.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Are Indians knowledgeable about Nigeria?</em></strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Many of them know about Nigeria because they have friends and family who work here. Those who didn’t know about Nigeria were quite curious about learning about our country, the culture and what they had heard in the media about us. I was asked a lot of questions about Nigeria and I was very pleased to answer.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Which were some of the tourist attractions that you visited during your stay?</em></strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">You don’t want to ever go to India and not see the Taj Mahal. I also drove around the city of New Delhi, checking out the embassies, central hospitals, the central temple and other places. I didn’t do as much sightseeing as I would have loved to, as I was also there for work.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Are there similarities between Bollywood and Nollywood?</em></strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">You cannot compare Bollywood with Nollywood. India is believed, by some, to be the holy grail of arts and culture. However, there is room for major synergy and collaboration, especially with the similarities and diversities in our cultures. I really think that Nollywood can learn several things from Bollywood. I met several filmmakers and we had intense and interesting conversations about working together and bringing some of my colleagues from Nigeria to star in a few films and attend film festivals in India. Right now, I am working on my first film production and it will feature a combination of Bollywood and Nollywood stars.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Which other countries would you like to visit?</em></strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">I would love to visit Brazil, Spain, Italy and many other exotic countries, especially where I have collaborators and friends.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>What advice can you offer prospective travellers?</em></strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Always carry a spare phone charger in a hand luggage; so, you can make Wifi calls while in transit. Make sure your credit card or debit card works at any international airport. Learn a few words of the language spoken in the country you are visiting, as you will need to interact with people. It is important to leave a good impression that you respect your host culture.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>How would you assess the security of lives and property in India while you were there?</em></strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">India seemed pretty safe to me because we rode scooters.On a particular night, we got ice cream and visited a temple. I did not notice anything out of the ordinary. Every country has bad elements but I didn’t have any nasty experience.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Did anything in India remind you about home?</em></strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Yes. There are lots of people there; it felt like I was in Lagos. Seeing the scooters, motorcycles and tricycles on the road reminded me a bit about Nigeria.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Was there anything you saw in India that you would like to see replicated in Nigeria?</em></strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The Indira market was clean and extremely quiet; I was literally shocked. Nobody shouted at you or talked at the top of their voices. People quietly went about their businesses without disturbing anybody. Imagine visiting Oshodi market and you meet it absolutely spotless and peaceful. That would be a fantastic dream to see come to life.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Copyright PUNCH.</em><br />\n</strong>All rights reserved.

I’m always thinking of fresh ideas and I’m always on the move. I am usually so busy that I don’t even have time to consider what anybody is saying somewhere.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">“There have been lots of untrue things written about me but I have just decided not to react. I keep my eyes on my goals and I keep moving. Those who want to talk can keep doing that while we soar.”</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">On the notion that some of the expensive properties she owns cannot be funded by her acting career, she said, “By now, you should know that most actors don’t survive on acting fees alone. There are a lot of other things involved. In the industry, there are endorsements, appearances and other services you can render with your brand.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">“You can also engage in other businesses outside the entertainment industry.

She tells <strong>TOFARATI IGE</strong> about the highlights of her career</em></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>What can you recall of your childhood?</em></strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">I always wanted to become a lawyer. As a kid, I used to talk a lot; so, people always told me that I would make a good lawyer. I also wanted to become a mother; I used to think it was just selected people that gave birth.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Which schools did you attend?</em></strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">For my elementary education, I attended Twins Nursery and Primary School in Lagos. For my post-elementary education, I went to Royal Kriston College, also in Lagos. I then attended the University of Ibadan where I bagged a degree in Theatre Arts.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>How did your foray into comedy begin?</em></strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">I have always known that I had the ability to make people laugh but I never regarded myself as a comedian. Our online skits started like a joke; it wasn’t something we planned. We were bored on a movie set and we made our first recording. The response was phenomenal. We have so many supporters and a lot of veterans in the industry advised us to keep it up.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Do your parents support your comedy career?</em></strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Yes, they are in full support. Every member of my family is happy with what I am doing. They are the first set of people that we show our skits to before we upload them on the Internet. We take their recommendations very seriously and we make necessary adjustments before making it available to the public. The interesting thing is that when we post the videos, the feedback we get from the audience is usually similar to what our family members said. They are great pillars for us.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>What are some of the most notable skits you’ve done?</em></strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Some of the most notable ones are <em>Pata Ojiji</em> and <em>Iyare</em> but I believe that all our skits are relevant. I like to think that our style is unique because we are advertise, using comedy. We can also do standup comedy because we were trained to be total entertainers.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>What do you aim to achieve with your career?</em></strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">I believe that everyone has something specific that they want to achieve with their lives. As for us, we intend to go into full-time standup comedy and to produce movies. For production, we would start with short films and move forward gradually. We also want to organise and host our own shows.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>What was the first impression you had of Valentina?</em></strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">We met for the first time at the University of Ibadan. It was a friend of mine that told me about her. The friend told me that she had seen someone that had a very similar stature as mine. I was happy because I like making friends. I approached her and as time went on, we got to know each other better. We used to call ourselves twins though we weren’t as close as we are now.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>How do you come up with these skits?</em></strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">We plan for all our skits. Some are by improvisation and some are freestyle. For the adverts that we do, we make sure that we get all the relevant information from the advertiser because those facts will make the advert really achieve its purpose of making whatever we are selling attractive to the viewers. After writing the scripts, we split the lines and we decide who says what. Coming up with the script is usually the hardest part of the job. For our personal skits, we discuss on what we want to address and we improvise; we don’t usually write scripts for those skits.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Do you sometimes disagree in the course of producing skits?</em></strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">No, I wouldn’t call what happens disagreement. For our skits, we usually talk about the idea at length and thrash the issues right there and then.That way, there is really no room for disagreement. We both bring ideas to the table. If there’s anything either of us doesn’t like, we would discuss about it and at the end of the day, the better idea wins.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Off-camera, are you both as close as you seem to be on camera?</em></strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Yes, we are; I would even say we are closer. We are more like sisters off-camera.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>What do you usually talk about when together?</em></strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">We are normal people and we talk about many things. I’m sure that when guys are together, they usually talk about girls. We talk about our daily experiences and when we see someone that admires us, or that we admire, we talk about it.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>What kind of man do you admire?</em></strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The most important thing is that he must be God-fearing; I’m not talking about somebody who’s just a churchgoer. He must also be handsome and presentable. He must be comfortable because with my status now, you wouldn’t expect me to follow someone who cannot even take care of himself. He must be loving and caring as well.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Do you have other interests aside from comedy?</em></strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">I do many things outside comedy. I am a fashion designer and actress.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>How do you like to dress?</em></strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">I like to wear whatever I am comfortable in; I don’t listen to what people have to say.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>What’s your favourite fashion item?</em></strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">My favourite fashion item is my wristwatch; I don’t go out without it. I like wearing my necklace (I never take it off) and sunglasses too.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Copyright PUNCH.</em><br />\n</strong>All rights reserved.

I had my post-elementary education at Roshallom International Secondary School located in Gowon Estate, Egbeda, Lagos, and Towergate Private School also in Lagos. I have an Ordinary National Diploma in Mass Communication from The Polytechnic, Ibadan. After that, I proceeded to the University of Ibadan, where I obtained a bachelor’s degree in Theatre Arts. Right now, I’m studying for a master’s degree in Theatre Arts in the same university.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>What were your ambitions as a child?</em></strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">I wanted to become a lawyer, and that’s because when I was a child,  I used to watch a particular advertisement in which a child acted as a lawyer; it really captivated me. However, man proposes and God disposes. I tried to study Law but it just did not work out. Meanwhile, acting had always been my second choice.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>How did your online skits come about?</em></strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">I was on set on a particular day with my partner but we didn’t have scenes to shoot at that particular time; so, we were at the hotel. At a point, boredom took over and we decided to keep ourselves busy. We made a recording of ourselves mimicking Yoruba movie adverts and when other people on the set, such as Jude Orhorha, watched the skit, they found it very hilarious. They advised us to upload it on social media. Largely, I am a very gentle and reserved person though I may be ‘crazy’ around my friends; so, I was a bit shy about making the video public. However, we eventually posted it online, and the response was overwhelming. We got a lot of followers, friend requests and phone calls, telling us that a lot of blogs had shared our video. We also got messages from some senior colleagues in the industry and they encouraged us. That gave us the push to do another recording, which we titled <em>Iyare</em>, and it was even bigger than the first. From then, people started calling us to make special adverts for them.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>How lucrative has this venture been for you?</em></strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">I believe that God actually chose this path for us because it has been quite lucrative. Most of the adverts on our Instagram page right now are paid for. People often tell us that our style of comedy is different because we make our viewers laugh and also advertise their products. However, it has also been challenging because we always have to be creative in advertising diverse products and services.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>What informed the name, Oshisko Twins?</em></strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">We noticed that in most movie adverts, they sing before giving out any information; so, when we wanted to record our first skit, we just randomly chose the name, Oshisko Films and Recording, and used it in our soundtrack. When it was time to choose an official name for our brand, we decided to go with Oshisko Twins. Our name used to be Entidel Media which was gotten from our names, Valentina (Enti) and Oyedele (del).</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>You’ve also worked with Basketmouth. How did that come about?</em></strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Basketmouth called for an online contest where he asked people to submit videos of themselves advertising his show; that he would pick the most creative. We got to know about the contest through another comedian, Omobaba. He had watched some of our skits online; so, when he met us at a show, he was very excited and he urged us to participate in the contest. We eventually won and  the win boosted our career. However, we had already recorded some skits that went viral before that particular one.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Do you do stand-up comedy?</em></strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Yes, we do but our style is different. When we are to perform stand-up comedy, we have to adapt our style to suit stage performance.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>How would you describe your relationship with your partner?</em></strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">We met at the University of Ibadan where we both studied Theatre Arts. There was a sort of ‘communal spirit’ in our department because we mostly had practical sessions and rehearsals. There were lots of opportunities to bond with one another. We also have similar stature which even made us even closer. We used to refer to ourselves as twin sisters. However, she is more dramatic, while I am gentle. After we graduated from the university, we went our separate ways but we met again at a movie location after our National Youth Service Corps programme. She is actually more than a sister to me, especially now, because we are so much into each other. A lot of people think that we are biological twin sisters and we don’t tell them otherwise because we enjoy the prayers and attention we get.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>How do you like to dress?</em></strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">I love dressing well and looking good. In our videos, we don’t really pay attention to how we look; the focus is more on the message we intend to pass. Sometimes, we even shoot the skits before having our bath. Outside the videos, it is a different ball game. When people meet us in real life, they tell us that we are more beautiful than we appear in our videos.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>What’s your favourite fashion item?</em></strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">I love shoes and recently, I have developed love for sunglasses.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Copyright PUNCH.</em><br />\n</strong>All rights reserved.

I have three siblings. My father was an engineer and he was always moving from one state to another. Whenever there was a need to move, we had no choice but to go with him. Though it was fun, the whole process of changing homes, schools and friends was quite hectic. We, however, adjusted easily. I was a very shy kid and a rebel, while my younger sister was an outgoing type. Looking back, I will say that my childhood was quite interesting. There were some ugly days, but I still had fun growing up.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Education</strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">I went to primary school in Suleja, Niger State. For my post-elementary education, I attended Federal Government Girls’ College, Calabar. I started a diploma programme in law, but later got a scholarship to study Political Science in Romania. I graduated with  a First Class degree. I will not say I was the smartest, but I was very determined. I had a lecturer who was racially prejudiced and he always made sure foreign students failed. This made it mandatory for me to do very well in my studies because I wanted to shame him.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Life after Big Brother Naija</strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">I really loved my stay in the Big Brother Naija house. One of the most memorable moments I had on the show was the day my sister visited. Since leaving BBN, things have been going well for me. I have had the privilege of meeting several amazing people and opportunities come my way every day. But for BBN, I may have had to struggle a little more to get those kinds of opportunities that have come my way so far. I went into the house as TBoss and came out as the president of BossNation. The love and support of my fans have been overwhelming. God raised strangers to fight for me and I feel very blessed by this.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Role models</strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">I look up to my mother a lot. I learnt most of the things I know now by watching her.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Criticisms</strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">I am not under any sort of pressure. I have always done things at my own pace, which is just fine by me. When it comes to criticism, assumption is the cheapest form of information. People will always have an opinion about everything and I’m not in the business of trying to convince people to think or say otherwise.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Regrets</strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">I don’t have regrets in life. I live every day as it comes and I believe that my past made me who I am today.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Current projects</strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">I got some endorsements and movie roles last year. I plan to do more movies this year, but I don’t want to reveal too much at the moment.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Romance</strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">I like to keep certain things private and my love life or relationship falls into that category. However, the story that I am engaged to a musician or anyone else for that matter is just a rumour. I am not engaged to be married to anybody and if such happens, everyone will know. At present, I am only focused on my brand and how to make it better.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Kemen</strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Whatever happened between us is in the past and we have both moved on. We have a cordial relationship.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Personality </strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">I just want to be a better person physically, spiritually, financially and otherwise. I want to continue being a role model to everyone who looks up to me. I believe that I’m an absolutely fantastic person. I am down to earth, but I like to be classy.  I am kind, fun to be with and outgoing. I also love to travel, cook, read horror novels, and watch romantic movies and comedies. I love children and the family unit. Even though I am outspoken, I could be diplomatic when I have to be. I am really an emotional person. I love my tattoos and piercings. I don’t play with the things of God too; going to church makes me happy.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Fashion</strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">I like being comfortable. I think it’s important to dress appropriately for an occasion and ‘slay’ when it is needed. I wear what fits into any particular occasion I’m attending.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Relaxation</strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">I relax by cleaning and putting the house together while listening to music. Some people may consider this as stressful, but that’s the best way I relax and I love it. I also love reading or watching TV series. I like to have a lot of snacks near me when I do this.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>BBNaija 2018</strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">I am excited about it and a lot is happening already. I have already made some comments about it and I stand by my words.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Copyright PUNCH.</em><br />\n</strong>All rights reserved.

It has done it before and it has seen the ample fruits, especially in terms of infrastructural and lifestyle facilities that many people from different parts of the world cannot resist.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">It is not only doing it again, it also seems to be thinking every minute, a virtue that sets it apart from many places where leaderships appear to be in enmity with quality thinking. Unfortunately, Africa naturally comes to mind whenever a dirge like this is being sung – especially the biggest but toddling culprit called Nigeria.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">So gripping has the Dubai’s story become that, of its about 11. 5 million population, only about 1. 5 million people are citizens, that is, of the emirate blood. The remaining 10 million residents are said to be expatriates from probably every part of the world. One guesses that, unlike the old slogan, ‘See Paris and die’, the song in the United Arabs Emirate star city is, ‘See Dubai and stay.’</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">But, so sorry! No matter how exciting the Dubai socio-economic landscape is, the visiting millions have to remain foreigners as the law does not allow them to become citizens. More on this later.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Well, there is so much to savour in the star city of the United Arabs Emirate that visitors — whether those on short or ‘permanent’ stay — have little cause to worry about not having the opportunity to become citizens. The city continues to tease and thrill everyone with solid institutions and novel projects and programmes that keep renewing themselves.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">For instance, this writer’s recent visit to Dubai, in company with some other journalists, showed that the likes of the J Marriott Marquis Hotel, the Dubai Mall, the Emirates Mall, La Mer, The Global Village and IMG World of Adventures provide experience great enough to makes one to feel at home.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">While Marriot, a 70-storey, two-tower five-star hotel, is reputed to be the world’s tallest and largest with vivid comfort, the Dubai Mall harbours so much that it is said to attract  more than 750,000 visitors every week.  The Global Village, which hosts culturally compliant houses of different regions and countries of the world, also has the fame of attracting five million people annually — according to figures from the Dubai Tourism.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">One of the newest attractions in Dubai, however, is the Dubai Frame, which, though is presented as a picture frame, is a landmark house of cultural and entertainment varieties. Beyond giving people an opportunity to take pictures and behold the gold-plated Dubai from the sky, the Dubai Frame serves as the memory of the city. It has in-built museums that give a view of what Dubai was before its visionary leaders, especially the king and visioneer, Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, took a heroic charge of the land and the people’s destiny. Perhaps more important, however, is the fact that visitors have the opportunity to come to terms with what is currently going on in the heads of the Dubai’s wise men, in terms of the future they want for themselves. In other words, while several of the much hyped democracies of the world  are busy stagnating the destinies of their peoples, Dubai is busy trying to surpass itself by designing a possible paradise ahead.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Inside The Dubai Frame, the visitor watches a documentary in which the establishment gives a picture of what the city will be in the next 50 years. It is a haven where robots will do many of the things that humans do now.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Sorry, no citizenship…</strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">In glittering and highly absorbing Dubai, the temptation to get carried away by entertainment and lifestyle-oriented facilities and products is high. Just indicate your choice and taste and everything begins to fall on your retinas and upon your laps. Anyway, most good things attract a price.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">But for those who are thirsty of cultural knowledge, the city has memorable things to offer. A place to get such is the Sheikh Mohammed Centre for Cultural Understanding. It is an institution that teaches visitors a lot about the culture of the UAE, with the belief that people who visit Dubai from different parts of the world need to know about their hosts, at least for the purpose of mutual understanding.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">This writer got a taste of what makes the city unique culturally, religiously and educationally. After a free lunch of local food, the host, simply identified as Fatyahah, spoke on their culture and the ideology that has worked for Dubai. According to her, the system does not tolerate religious extremism. Its education system is so liberal that it offers learners varieties right from childhood — in terms of curriculum.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The host added that the Emirate did not grant citizenship to expatriates while marriage between the people and foreigners is a rarity. If a foreigner (man) marries a Dubai woman, there is no citizenship for him. Indeed, the children produced by the marriage do not become citizens until they attain age 18. But if a member of the Emirate marries a woman from outside the country, she will be granted citizenship. The host noted that the need to protect the people’s legacy informed the rule.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The centre’s profile further indicated, “Expatriates and UAE nationals are neighbours; however, they can also be strangers. His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Vice-President and Prime Minister of the UAE and Ruler of Dubai, saw the need to reach out and educate expatriates in the traditions and customs of the UAE. His vision led to the creation of The Sheikh Mohammed Centre for Cultural Understanding in 1998.”</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Other places of interest in Dubai include the evening desert safari, which provides the opportunity to experience the famous Red Dunes safari; the IMG Worlds of Adventure, an indoor amusement park in Dubai.

The problem is not about being in a group, it has to do with the music business. I tell people not to put pressure on artistes. If an artiste’s career doesn’t last for more than five years, do not crucify him or her. A musician doesn’t need to be active forever. If you do five years as an artiste and you are getting saturated, what stops you from taking a break? You can always come back after the break. The fact that some people are still relevant for 20 years doesn’t mean everyone has such grace.”</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Copyright PUNCH.<br />\n</strong>All rights reserved.

I have always wanted to run my own record company, even before I joined Kcee, but I needed to start from somewhere. Five Star Music was like a college for me; I went to school and I graduated. We still talk like we used to; the only difference is that I am now my own boss.”</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Excited about his first single since exiting Five Star, <em>Skibobo</em>, he said, “It is the first of many songs that I plan to release this year.

I am ready to put out more music this year and I am not the Skiibii people used to know. I need to show the world what I am capable of. When I was under a label, I couldn’t do whatever I wanted but the story is different now.

I tell people I have been a vegetarian for 37 years. Even when my friends were having sex with two girls at the same time in those days, I didn’t join them. I have never done what these girls and boys call threesome despite being famous and I am sure there are other people who have never done that too.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">“When people attribute recklessness to youthful exuberance, I get worried because I once passed through that stage too. I believe it is all about your upbringing. The fact that you are young doesn’t mean you should be wayward.”</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Speaking about his unwillingness to change his music to appeal to a younger audience, Kimono stated, “I have been playing reggae music for years and I don’t plan to change my style or dilute it. Those who want to listen will surely do. The truth is that you can force a horse to the river, but you can’t force it to drink from it. We still have a lot of youths who know my value. I don’t believe that all the youths are senseless.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">“I believe two million youths out of five million youths know the difference between good and bad. If I had changed my style, I would probably not be here talking to you. I am certain the media would have crucified me that I did it for the love of money. My brand of music has kept me alive and still makes me relevant.”</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">However, the reggae exponent released some songs last year, which didn’t have much impact. He says it is because they weren’t accompanied with music videos. “I plan to shoot videos this year. Though people think CDs don’t sell again, I belong to the school of thought that believes that CDs must sell. The Internet is still not available to everyone in the country, especially for people in the North. Many people in the rural areas still prefer buying CDs,” he said.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Copyright PUNCH.<br />\n</strong>All rights reserved.

When she discovered what I did, I was reprimanded.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Education</strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">For my elementary education, I attended quite a number of schools. They are Aunty Nikky Nursery &amp; Primary School, Alakara; Anglican Primary School, Idi Oro; and Community Primary School, Alaba Expressway, Mile 2, all in Lagos State. I also attended two schools for my post-elementary education. They are C&amp;S College, Sanya, Lagos, and Remo Secondary School, in Sagamu, Ogun State. For my tertiary education, I studied Geography and Regional Planning at the Olabisi Onabanjo University, Ago-Iwoye, Ogun State. As a child, I really wanted to become a pilot.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Career</strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">When I was in Remo Secondary School, I joined a theatre group known as <em>Fine Mates</em>. However, I officially got into the industry through a marketer called Suntab. He used to live close to my cousin’s house. I later enrolled with Sama A Productions, where I got more knowledge about the movie industry. The first time I ever appeared on set was in 1999 and it was an experience I would never forget. The name of the movie was <em>Aso Esu Beleke</em>, and it was produced by Toba Opaleye.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Movies</strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">I have acted in quite a lot of movies but the ones I can readily recall are <em>Aso Esu Beleke, Emi Eko, Ikoko Meta, Itara Ife, Ofin Kefa</em>, among others. I have played a lot of roles but I would like to take on the character of a native warrior and powerful woman. Before I accept any script, I consider my integrity. I also look out for the content and the message the movie aims to pass, and of course, the benefits in it for me.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Break</strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">I needed to take a break and focus on caring for my daughter, at least to the stage where I know I can go on set for weeks and not bat an eyelid. The mother-daughter bond needs to be strengthened at an early stage to let her know that mummy will always be there for her.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Music</strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">I started my music career in Cherubim and Seraphim church in the 90s as an assistant lead singer. As an artiste, I face the same challenges that everyone else grapples with. These include access to funds, especially when you don’t have a record deal; getting publicity; airplay; and shooting good videos. The pay in the industry is very small, especially when your music isn’t in vogue. I released two songs last year:<em> Champion</em> feat. Oritsefemi, and <em>Mr DJ</em> feat. Oritsefemi and Jaywon. Right now, I’m working on a love song titled, <em>Abeere</em>. For now, I don’t have plans to become a full-time artiste; I have a lot of movie projects to attend to.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Challenges</strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Generally, some of the recurrent challenges that I have in the industry have to do with marketing, the attitude of some actors, getting good locations, and time.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Breakthrough</strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">My song with Pasuma in 2004, <em>Tell me why</em>, and my movie, <em>Ikoko Meta</em>. Pasuma is a senior colleague and a true brother. People like him are rare, and I cherish my relationship with him.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Marriage</strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">I don’t really want to discuss my marriage. However, some of the lessons I have learnt in matrimony is that one should never ignore red flags, especially when you are still courting. One should also always heed advice. Concerning reports that my marriage has collapsed, I am indifferent to whatever is said about me. Everyone battles one thing or the other and I don’t listen to hearsays. If I’m led, I pray against negative news or rumours, and if not, I just face my life and family. I don’t agree that celebrities’ marriages don’t last long; I only think celebrities are being unnecessarily trampled upon, especially the female ones. It is easy to see celebrities’ flaws because they are in the spotlight. However, the people out there also have unbelievable issues that they secretly deal with. They are only protected because they are not in the limelight. The fact is that many marriages don’t last long in the world we live in today and it takes only the grace of God to keep a healthy home.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Odunlade Adekola/Kemi Afolabi</strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">It wasn’t a big deal. It was just a minor misunderstanding that unnecessarily escalated. It has been duly resolved and we have moved on to other productive things. My relationship with Odunlade Adekola is cordial now.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Interests</strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Apart from movies and music, I love to write. I also have interest in fashion designing.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Fashion</strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">My style can be described as creative and sophisticated. Like every other fashionista, I always consider my body shape in whatever I put on. I only wear what suits me and what I feel confident in. My favourite fashion items are sunglasses.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Relaxation</strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">I hardly relax; I work from ‘sun-up’ to sunset. However, once in a while, I travel out of the country on vacation. I love to visit the beach.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Copyright PUNCH.<br />\n</strong>All rights reserved.

I have yet to do any solo show because I am not ready to do what I would really like to do. I have a massive plan, but the time has not come to unleash it. For my concert, I plan to invite an international RnB act. Very soon, everyone will witness it. I believe anything worth doing is worth doing well. Generally, I had a great outing last year. I released a couple of songs that did well internationally and locally. I am ready to drop a five-track EP this month, precisely on February 14. There are some artistes that release singles every month but I am not that type of singer. I am strategic with the way I put out materials. I believe everyone has his or her own technique.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Are you satisfied with your growth in music?</em></strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">I love my growth. I prefer to have 1,000 fans who are loyal to me than a million fans who are not loyal. When you talk about people who broke into the industry from reality shows, I am one of them, even though I didn’t win. As a matter of fact, people always think I won Project Fame. I believe you need to understand your fans. However, that doesn’t mean you should be lazy or rest on your laurels. While you are still pushing to be a better person, one needs to be grateful to God. I owe everything I have achieved to God, but most people don’t know that I work a lot. I tell people that I have lost four years of sleep in my life. I go to bed at 4am daily. However, there are a lot of people who work as hard as I do, yet they don’t get results. For me, it has been God, patience, focus and hard work. I know where I want to be and I am working towards it. I am a talented boy who is enjoying the favour of God. Once God sees your heart and how much you are passionate about what you do, He blesses you.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Are you a lover boy?</em></strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">If you call me a lover boy, I think you are right. I am an RnB singer and when you talk about that genre of music, the first thing that comes to your mind is love. I sing about different stages of love and my major fans are women. For every man who sings, women should be their prime target because they bring everyone on board.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Have you broken a lady’s heart in recent times?</em></strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">There is no one I can remember at the moment. I try my best to avoid breaking any woman’s heart.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Do you believe in love?</em></strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Yes, I do. Loving someone is a sacrifice because you often have to go out of your comfort zone to ensure the person is happy. Love is a sacrifice.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Do you have a child?</em></strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">I don’t and it doesn’t mean artistes that have baby mamas are irresponsible.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Have you forgiven the Nigerian police for your recent feud with them?</em></strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">I honestly don’t want to talk about that again. However, I want people to know that I was not rude to them as claimed. I have never been rude to anyone, regardless of the person’s position, because I had a good upbringing. Even if you wrong me, I will react respectfully. I don’t believe in violence or being rude to people.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>What has fame deprived you of?</em></strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Obviously, there are certain things that I enjoyed doing before fame came calling that I cannot do again because of my new life. However, I still look for a way to do things. I still take walks on the streets or go to public places alone. I think that makes fans appreciate you more.  Fans don’t see us as ordinary people, so when you do things they do, they relate with you better.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Have you ever wished that you were not a celebrity?</em></strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">I cannot be fed up with the place I am in right now because I try my best to live my life. I don’t try to be another person because I am famous; I have not allowed fame to change me.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Do you have plans for marriage this year?</em></strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">I am certain that I will get married but I don’t know how soon it will happen. You don’t need to rush into marriage because it is an institution you are not expected to abandon once you are in it. Though people get married to the wrong people, marriage is a beautiful thing. However, when a marriage turns violent, I always advise people to walk away because staying alive is important. I am taking my time as I don’t want to rush in and rush out.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Have you found a suitable lady?</em></strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">I have yet to. But I believe in marriage and it is something I would love to experience.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>What is your greatest concern about the industry?</em></strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">I want every genre of music to be respected and given the same opportunity. In Nigeria, you don’t always see awards for other genres apart from the popular ones. The media also have a role to play in this. They need to encourage people who do other genres of music by giving them more airplay.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Do you see RnB music becoming as popular as hip-hop in Nigeria?</em></strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Everyone likes RnB music. You cannot be with your girlfriend and start playing rap music. We are in a nation where everyone wants to forget their struggles. People don’t want anything that will make them reflect on bad memories; they would rather settle for songs that make them happy. Though I understand that RnB music has a certain market, I still believe it will get to be accepted more in Nigeria over time. However, I don’t think it can ever be as popular as pop music because of the environment we live in.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Are you involved in any other business?</em></strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">It is very important for every artiste to have different sources of income. I don’t depend on music alone; I have invested in a couple of things. However, music is the major thing I do because it brings in the money. For me, what matters most is what you do with the money music brings in for you.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Do you think you are the best RnB singer in Nigeria at the moment?</em></strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">I think it is left for fans and music critics to state who their favourite RnB singer is. However, I am certain that wherever they are talking about RnB music in Nigeria, my name will be mentioned.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Have you ever thought of becoming a rapper?</em></strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">No, it cannot happen. I can’t rap to save my life. I don’t even see myself trying to do rap music till I die.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>When do you regard as the turning point in your career?</em></strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">People accepted me right from the days of Project Fame. My music career has been a process and I will never despise my days of little beginning. The first song that put me in the limelight was <em>Stupid Song</em> with Bez. Also, people began to notice me after I did songs with M.I and Wizkid. Apart from my original songs, the collaborations I did in the past also contributed to my growth in the industry.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>What makes you different from other artistes?</em></strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">I feel my vocals stand me out from any other artiste. Every artiste has his or her strong point. When you hear a song, you can tell it is my voice without seeing the video.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Didn’t you feel it was the end of the road when you didn’t win Project Fame?</em></strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">I didn’t see it in that manner. Getting the third position with money and a car was enough for me. We had people in the competition that could sing well but didn’t go home with anything. I felt if I could go that far, there was hope for me in the music industry.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>What do you find disturbing about Project Fame?</em></strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">I don’t think there is anything disturbing about the show presently. I only feel the participants should keep working hard and ensure they capitalise on the exposure they got from the reality show.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>What came to mind when you were called upon to be a judge on the show?</em></strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">I felt accomplished. There was no time I thought I would be a judge on a reality show. I didn’t lobby for it or spoke to anybody to get me on board. It only proves that if you work hard and you are consistent, you will always stand out. It will be recalled that I didn’t even win when I participated in the show, but I was deemed fit to be a judge years later. I have been a contestant; so, I know what it feels like to be in that position. I am also in the industry now and I know what is required to be successful in music.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Do you agree that products of reality shows struggle in the real world?</em></strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">I can’t speak for anyone but myself.  However, when you come from a reality show, you need to work harder because things will not come to you on a platter of gold.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>At the time you contested Project Fame, didn’t you feel you were bigger than a reality show?</em></strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">For you to succeed, you must suppress your ego. Since a competition will be helpful to your career, why can’t you participate? It doesn’t change the fact that you’ve been doing music for years. I have heard people say that they cannot go for reality shows, but that is just their beliefs.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Copyright PUNCH.<br />\n</strong>All rights reserved.

This is despite the fact that at a recent press conference, some members of COSON, led by Efe Omoregbe, Dare Fasasi, Obi Asika and Audu Makori, had said Okoroji was no longer the chairman of the society.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">In a chat with <strong>Sunday Scoop</strong>, Okoroji stated that he was not aware of the press conference. He added, “COSON has been one of the most stable organisations in the history of the Nigerian creative industry. However, as we grow, it is normal for certain people to disagree with the system but you can see the efficient way our members reacted and handled the situation. The issue was resolved in 2017 and we are stronger in 2018.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">“We have many members, so if five or six people don’t agree with us, how does that form a faction? We don’t have any division. If as a CEO, your manager leaves your company and establishes another, is the company another faction? Why didn’t they hold the press conference at COSON House?  In every organisation, there are disgruntled members; it happens in churches too. They tried to divide us, but they have failed.”</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Okoroji argued that for Sir Shina Peters and KSB to join the COSON board, it was an indication that the leadership was moving in the right direction.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">“We didn’t have Shina Peters and KSB on our board before now. With this development, don’t you think we are moving forward? I am very happy with where we are at the moment. I can assure you that by the end of next year, you will see a different COSON,” he said.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Highlighting the major challenges faced by COSON, Okoroji lamented that it was tough getting Nigerians to believe in them. He said, “In Nigeria, everyone believes nothing can work because many things have not worked in the country. However, at COSON, we make things work.”</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">He also rubbished the insinuation that the copyright society was created to serve old generation artistes alone. “There are many young musicians who are members of COSON.

The novelist, who was born in Nigeria but now lives in the United States, followed up with a Facebook post the next day arguing that the bookstore question was &#8220;giving legitimacy to a deliberate, entitled, tiresome, sweeping base ignorance about Africa&#8221;.</p>\n<p>But not everyone wholeheartedly agrees. &#8220;You can&#8217;t say there aren&#8217;t any bookstores or libraries in Nigeria, that&#8217;s ridiculous,&#8221; Tabia Princewill, a columnist told AFP.</p>\n<p>&#8220;But they aren&#8217;t pretty, and they are often religious books or educational books. In public libraries, there are almost no books,&#8221; Princewill said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s shameful and it is not being anti-Africa to admit it.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The African elite don&#8217;t want to face the reality.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>&#8211; Polarising question &#8211;</strong></p>\n<p>The bookstore debate is so polarising because it isn&#8217;t just about access to books, it&#8217;s also about the country&#8217;s troubled education system.</p>\n<p>As the population of West Africa&#8217;s biggest economy explodes, the government is struggling to educate its 190 million people.</p>\n<p>Nigeria has a 60 percent literacy rate, one of the lowest among frontier markets, according to investment banking firm Renaissance Capital in a Tuesday note.</p>\n<p>There are vast regional discrepancies in the country, with the south boasting much higher literacy rates than the north, yet teacher quality and student attendance are perennial problems.</p>\n<p>In her Facebook post, Adichie acknowledged the devastating effect of the Boko Haram jihadist insurgency on bookstores in the northeast.</p>\n<p>She said her uncle had owned a store in Maiduguri, capital of northeast Borno State and birthplace of Boko Haram, but it had to close down when the city began to feel &#8220;too unsafe&#8221;.</p>\n<p>While the north struggles to counter the fundamentalist ideology of the jihadists, whose name translates to &#8220;Western education is forbidden&#8221;, the south has its own issues.</p>\n<p>Neighbourhood bookstores in Lagos, the country&#8217;s commercial capital with 20 million inhabitants, have to contend with patchy electricity, subsequent mould, and a market flooded with pirated books.</p>\n<p><strong>&#8211; Pirated books &#8211;</strong></p>\n<p>Still, some find a way. Kayode Odumosu has always loved books and at age 11, he started working at his school library.</p>\n<p>In 1993, Odumosu opened Lagos Book Club in Festac, a small middle-class neighbourhood. His 3,000 second-hand books are stacked tightly next to one another on long metal shelves.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I sell Shakespeare and all of Chimamanda&#8217;s novels,&#8221; he says with pride.</p>\n<p>On a recent day in Jazzhole &#8212; the bookshop Adichie describes as her &#8220;favourite in Lagos&#8221; &#8212; the power is out and the air is muggy. There are biographies of Afrobeat king Fela Kuti next to books on Tehran and Venice.</p>\n<p>Owner Kunle Tejuoso took over the family business in 1975. &#8220;Well before the birth of Chimamanda,&#8221; he said with some amusement.</p>\n<p>The bookstore controversy doesn&#8217;t bother him much. &#8220;I&#8217;m used to it,&#8221; he said pragmatically. &#8220;When Westerners come to my shop they always have a little shock.&#8221;</p>\n<p>For all Nigeria&#8217;s problems, books are an integral part of its culture, he said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The literary scene is exploding in Nigeria, we have a lot of new writers who make young people want to read.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Our greatest challenge is the internet.

as well as Record of the Year, which recognizes top tune, for the title track &#8212; a tale of good times with beautiful women set to 1980s-style synths and rhythms.</p>\n<p>The Recording Academy, the body of 13,000 music professionals, also gave him Song of the Year, which awards songwriting, for another track on the album &#8212; &#8220;That&#8217;s What I Like,&#8221; an old-school ode to making love in high style.</p>\n<p>The 32-year-old singer, sporting a bright smile and sunglasses, recalled how he first performed as a child for tourists in his native Hawaii.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I remember seeing it firsthand &#8212; people dancing that had never met each other from two sides of the globe, dancing with each other, toasting with each other, celebrating together,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;All I wanted to do with this album was that,&#8221; he told thousands of industry players at Madison Square Garden in New York, where the Grammys temporarily shifted after 15 years in Los Angeles.</p>\n<h2>&#8211; Anti-climax for rap &#8211;</h2>\n<p>Mars won all of the awards for which he was in the running on what was expected to be a major night for hip-hop, which for the first time dominated nominations for the major categories.</p>\n<p>But the industry either preferred Mars, or the vote for rappers split.</p>\n<p>Hip-hop mogul Jay-Z, who had led with eight nominations, ended the night empty-handed.</p>\n<p>Kendrick Lamar for the second time swept all rap categories but failed to win the general prizes.</p>\n<p>His five awards included Best Rap Album for &#8220;DAMN.,&#8221; a turn to a classic hip-hop sound.</p>\n<p>Lamar opened the televised gala with a frenetic show, spitting out his verses as he was joined by U2 frontman Bono amid a sea of kung fu dancers who later fell to the ground as if struck by bullets.</p>\n<h2>&#8211; No longer &#8216;pretend-winning&#8217; in shower  &#8211;</h2>\n<p>Alessia Cara, who rose from making YouTube videos in her bedroom to becoming a socially conscious pop singer, won the closely watched award of Best New Artist.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been pretend-winning Grammys since I was a kid in my shower,&#8221; the 21-year-old from suburban Toronto told the gala.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I just wanted to encourage everyone to support real music and real artists because everyone deserves the same shot,&#8221; Cara added.</p>\n<p>Cara has quickly found her voice as a singer with singles such as &#8220;Here,&#8221; which describes the dread of forced emotions at a party, and &#8220;Scars to Your Beautiful,&#8221; a call for healthy body image.</p>\n<h2>&#8211; Rallying for women &#8211;</h2>\n<p>Amid rising attention to gender discrimination in the entertainment industry following revelations of sexual misconduct by Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein, top stars &#8212; notably Lady Gaga &#8212; walked the red carpet wearing white roses in solidarity with abuse victims and in an appeal for equality.</p>\n<p>Kesha &#8212; whose pleas to break a deal with her producer, whom she accused of rape, initially fell on deaf ears in the industry &#8212; brought some audience members to tears with her deeply personal song &#8220;Praying.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Her face intense and her voice ferocious, Kesha sang the autobiographical lyrics: &#8220;After everything you&#8217;ve done / I can thank you for how strong I have become.&#8221;</p>\n<p>A clutch of female vocalists including Cyndi Lauper offered her both symbolic and literal support, with Kesha embracing the group in a bear-hug as she finished.</p>\n<p>Singer Janelle Monae, introducing Kesha, said that the music industry needed to address its own abuse problems.</p>\n<p>&#8220;To those who would dare try and silence us, we offer you two words: Time&#8217;s Up!&#8221; Monae said, using a slogan for the movement launched on New Year&#8217;s Day by hundreds of prominent women in the entertainment industry.</p>\n<p>Rapper Logic added his own voice later on stage, telling women: &#8220;Stand tall and crush all predators under the weight of your heart that is full of the love they will never take away from you.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The Grammys also featured a tribute to music fans killed in attacks in Las Vegas and Manchester last year with country stars Eric Church, Maren Morris and Brothers Osbourne together performing Eric Clapton&#8217;s mournful &#8220;Tears in Heaven.&#8221;</p>\n<h2>&#8211; Trump skewered &#8211;</h2>\n<p>The Grammys didn&#8217;t hold back from more light-hearted political commentary.</p>\n<p>Noting President Donald Trump&#8217;s reported disdain for reading &#8212; and the Grammy award for spoken word &#8212; host James Corden introduced a video of famous names reciting from &#8220;Fire and Fury: Inside The Trump White House,&#8221; the sensational account of the tycoon-turned-president&#8217;s first year in office.</p>\n<p>Musicians known for their criticism of Trump started reading from the book including John Legend, Cher and &#8212; smoking from his trademark joint &#8212; Snoop Dogg.</p>\n<p>The video ends with Hillary Clinton, who lost to Trump in the bitter 2016 election.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The Grammy&#8217;s in the bag,&#8221; quips Clinton, whose confidence during her race against Trump proved ill-advised.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n'},excerpt:{rendered:"<p>Bruno Mars, who has revived retro funk and R&amp;B for a new generation, on Sunday swept the Grammy Awards in a surprise snub for the hip-hop world, which had hoped for a major breakthrough on the music industry&#8217;s biggest night.

avoid baby mama, I don’t sleep with a girl without condom — Adekunle Gold"},content:{rendered:'<p style="text-align: justify;">Adekunle Kosoko, aka Adekunle Gold, speaks with OLUSHOLA RICKETTS about his childhood, music career and other issues</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Were you satisfied with the outcome of your show in December?</em></strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Yes, I thank God. We had the first two editions of the show, <em>One Night Stand with Adekunle Gold and the 79th Element</em>, in London and Dublin, last year. We then ended it in Nigeria. Organising a show in Nigeria can be difficult and I was worried, but everything turned out well at the end of the day.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Why do you like to sing about love?</em></strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">I like love but I don’t make only love songs. If you listen to my debut album, <em>Gold</em>, there are six songs on it that have nothing to do with love. I see things daily and I sing about them. I like to sing about things that happen to people because the audience relates to those things easily.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Have you ever had a one-night stand before?</em></strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Even if I have had that experience, do you expect me to say it in an interview?</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Do you get nude pictures on social media?</em></strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">I get a lot of that from ladies and it is fun, I must confess. There was a time in my life that I tried to get attention from ladies, but it was hard. It is a different story now and I am enjoying every bit of it.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>How have you been able to avoid scandals?</em></strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">I am decent in anything I do. I am a smooth operator.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>How does your girlfriend cope with the attention you get from the opposite sex?</em></strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">She understands the nature of my job but sometimes, she asks questions. I like to keep my relationship away from the public. What if my girlfriend doesn’t want to be in the limelight? I think people like me because of my music, not because of what I do in my private moments.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Do you have plans to have a baby mama?</em></strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">I don’t want that for myself. It will be a disgrace to my family if I have a child born out of wedlock. I can only speak for myself. I was not brought up that way.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>What if you ‘mistakenly’ get a lady pregnant?</em></strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Why should such mistakes happen? There is a way you can protect yourself. I cannot have sex with a lady without using a condom. For me, it is just wise to do the right thing. I don’t want to find myself in any drama.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Are you under pressure from your parents to get married?</em></strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">We have an agreement. We agreed that I should focus on my music career first before venturing into marriage.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Some people feel you didn’t give </em></strong><em>One Direction <strong>(an English-Irish pop group), credit for your hit song, </strong>Sade<strong>. Is that true?</strong></em></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Was that what people said? All the blogs that posted the story then said it was a cover of <em>One Direction’</em>s song. My problem with most Nigerians is that we don’t check facts before we conclude. I am not the type who copies people’s songs without giving them credit. I said it everywhere then that <em>Sade</em> was a cover of a song. To be honest, a lot of people in Nigeria didn’t know about <em>One Direction </em>until I released <em>Sade</em>. When they now discovered the song, they just concluded I stole the idea because of the similarity but I gave due credit to the group.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Sade was inspired by a girl who rejected you at a time. Did she later throw herself at you when fame came?</em></strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">There was a lady I really liked in 2012 but she told me she was not ready for a relationship. I disturbed her for almost a year and it didn’t happen. I just felt I should sing about it in 2014. We never dated even when I became famous. When she rejected me, we were friends and we are still friends.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Why didn’t you press further after fame came?</em></strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Maybe by then, I was no longer interested in her. I think I got over her at some point. She has a boyfriend now.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Would you have loved to date her if she was still single?</em></strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">I cannot really say. We had a conversation some time ago and I thanked her for rejecting me. If she had said yes and we had started dating, I would have been too comfortable and I may not have written <em>Sade</em>.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>How did you handle the rejection?</em></strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">I thought I wasn’t the kind of man she wanted. She is a pretty girl and I was just a random boy from Ikotun, Lagos. I felt perhaps, I needed to make money before she would agree to date me.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>How would you describe your childhood experience?</em></strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Most people think I was raised in Bariga, Lagos, because I was signed to Olamide’s YBNL. I was actually raised in Ifako-Agege, before moving to Ikotun, both in Lagos.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Are you from a rich background?</em></strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">I am from a very modest background. I attended public schools. My father is a principal while my mother is a teacher. I really enjoyed growing up in Ikotun and that was where I learnt most of the things I know. I later went to the Lagos State Polytechnic to study Arts.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Do you still practise graphic designing?</em></strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Yes, I design most of my works myself.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>How come you didn’t follow the path of your parents who are in the educational sector?</em></strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">My parents were indifferent about my decision to do music. My father wasn’t even interested at all. He used to warn me not to disturb him with noise, but I always knew what I wanted to become. When I told them I wanted to study arts, they didn’t object to it. My father is a graphic artist and a painter as well. I am the first child of my parents and the only son.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Who were your role models while growing up?</em></strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">While growing up, I listened to Ebenezer Obey and Sunny Ade a lot. Both of them are my idols. They have done it all. They created sounds that were unique to them. KSA has set a model for others to follow. He is an amazing person and performer. Before I go for shows at times, I look at KSA’s pictures for inspiration.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Do you still have a cordial relationship with your former boss, Olamide?</em></strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">If there are issues, he is one of the people I run to for help. I tell him my worries and we share ideas. I don’t have any problem with Olamide and he understands that too.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Is it true that he treated Kesh specially while you were at YBNL?</em></strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">I don’t know about that; Olamide catered for us equally. There was no time I wanted to do a video that he didn’t give me money and he never wasted time.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>What’s the clear difference between now and when you were signed to YBNL?</em></strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">I have more responsibilities now, unlike when I had people who were supporting me. Then, I didn’t have to be the one attending to emails or certain things and it was less stressful for me. My present team is still small, but we are growing daily.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Has playing with a band changed your style of music?</em></strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">My performance fee has increased because I now perform with a band. I should have taken such step earlier as I now see myself as a better artiste. I now avoid shows where I cannot play live music.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Do you rely on alcohol or any substance for inspiration?</em></strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">What extra thing do you need to tell a story? I don’t need any support for me to go on stage and I have fun with my band. I also relate to people during performances and that has been helpful.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Copyright PUNCH.<br />\n</strong>All rights reserved.

However, he believes he didn’t gain as much as most people think.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The actor told <strong>Sunday Scoop</strong> that he was only used as an experiment and didn’t benefit much from the brand. He said, “People used to call me the Gulder man anywhere I visited. I couldn’t even get jobs from other brands because I was identified with Gulder. I must confess that winning the show came with plenty of disadvantages. At times, I feel I would have done better in showbiz if I had not won the show but God knows best. I was not even given a car and I was given lesser money than subsequent winners. You know when you want to start something fresh, you need to test run it. I was the person they used to test run GUS. ”</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Speaking further, he said, “The last time Gulder did something was in 2014, which was the last GUS. Since then, we’ve not done anything together. I think they recently started putting our advert on billboards.”</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Claiming that he doesn’t feel bad that the public seems to have forgotten about him, Ezeugo said, “I like a simple life and I keep things private. If you are someone who is not thrilled by material things, you will cope very well with any situation you find yourself. I was never carried away by the fame. I don’t even like showing off or flaunting my pictures on social media.”</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Speaking on what he is working on, Ezeugo said, “We are filming Royal Castle at the moment. It is my first television series, but I have featured in other movies.  My biggest movie, so far, is Ultimate Warrior, which was produced in Enugu State in 2008. I hardly go for auditions; I only feature in movies I am called for. I am involved in other business. I make footwear and leather products, though it is a family business.”</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Copyright PUNCH.<br />\n</strong>All rights reserved.
