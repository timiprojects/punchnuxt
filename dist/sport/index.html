Guardiola told reporters on Friday.</p>\n<p>City’s desire to push through a move for the skilful Algerian was heightened last month by injuries to attackers Leroy Sane and Gabriel Jesus, although the former made a swift return from his ankle problem and played in the impressive midweek Champions League win in Basel.</p>\n<p><strong>&#8211; Rotation &#8211;</strong></p>\n<p>Now, Jesus, who has not played in 2018 due to a knee injury, has returned to first-team training and could be in contention for a dramatic recall for the League Cup Final with Arsenal a week on Sunday.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Today he is going to play in part of the session with the group,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It&#8217;s good news.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know when he&#8217;ll be ready definitely to be with us, with the team, but the first step is they made one or two weeks training alone and today is the first with the team,&#8221; the Spaniard added.</p>\n<p>German international Sane, meanwhile, returned from his injury at least a month ahead of schedule and his appearance in Switzerland, where City recorded a superb 4-0 victory, was a welcome boost even if Guardiola still expects more from his winger.</p>\n<p>&#8220;He played 20 minutes with the ball okay, without the the ball not perfect,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;He has to be involved with and without the ball, he can do it. We&#8217;ll give him the passes, the problems we had with the strikers, we need all four them, it&#8217;s important to have him back.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Guardiola&#8217;s next challenge is the visit to third tier Wigan in Monday&#8217;s fifth round FA Cup tie, ahead of the League Cup Final six days later and, with so many players returning from injury, the City manager is optimistic he will not need to rotate his squad too heavily between fixtures.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It depends (on time) between the games. he said. &#8220;Between the game in Basel, we had six days and then we&#8217;ll have six days until the final, they can recover.</p>\n<p>&#8220;So we&#8217;ll see, we&#8217;ve another two or three sessions.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Longer term, Guardiola can also look forward to a place in the last eight of the Champions League after the midweek win, one of a number of excellent results for English clubs, which also saw Tottenham draw at Juventus and Liverpool enjoy a 5-0 victory away to Porto.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Now I feel English being in this competition, I feel part of this league,&#8221; said the former Barcelona and Bayern Munich manager.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s great news they got great results and we will see what Manchester United and Chelsea do next week.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Of the three teams, two almost qualified and Tottenham got a great result, though they must perform again.&#8221;</p>\n<p>AFP</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n'},excerpt:{rendered:"<p>Pep Guardiola has defended Manchester City following complaints from Leicester manager Claude Puel over their pursuit of Riyad Mahrez.

Oliseh was on Wednesday  ‘suspended’  by  struggling Dutch second division  club Fortuna Sittard over “unacceptable actions”.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Oliseh, who was appointed by the  Eerste Divisie  side as their manager  on December 27, 2016 came under pressure from the outfit’s hierarchy after the team  slid down the table after suffering their fourth straight loss.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The former  Ajax and Juventus midfielder, who became a cult hero  at Fortuna Sittard Stadion after  helping  Sittard escape  relegation last season, was reportedly sacked by the club   last month,  but the Dutch side  denied the reports.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Fortunezen, who are desperate to gain  an automatic promotion to the Dutch top-flight  at the end of the season, also  denied they were at loggerheads with the former Nigeria coach.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">But  the club announced on their official website on Wednesday that they had  asked Oliseh to step aside.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"> Sittard also announced  that they had appointed their youth team’s head coach Claudio Braga as the senior team’s caretaker manager “until the  club has found a new trainer”.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">“Several attempts by the club to encourage a change in the coach’s behaviour have unfortunately not worked, resulting in an unworkable situation,” the  club said.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">“The board of Fortuna Sittard emphasises that the decision to suspend Sunday Oliseh is not motivated by the current sporting performance.”</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">“The coach’s unacceptable actions have made cooperation between many people within the organisation impossible – from players to employees.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">“Fortuna Sittard regrets the decision, but states that the club interest goes above all else.”</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Oliseh left his job as the Super Eagles manager in February 2016 under a cloud of controversy.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"> He was alleged to have  left after falling out with his  players and some top officials of  the Nigeria Football Federation.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">However,   Oliseh fired back on his Twitter account, claiming that the club decided to suspend him because he refused to play ball.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"> The  Atlanta ’96 Olympic Games gold medallist  wrote,  “I confirm: due to my refusal to participate in illegal activities at Fortuna Sittard  and  violate the law, I have been suspended from my duties as coach by the foreign owners of Fortuna.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">“Unfortunate for the lovely fans, my players and  our hard-fought phenomenal positioning for promotion.”</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Copyright PUNCH.</strong><strong><br />\n</strong><em>All rights reserved.

Well, it’s not actually a pool as it is just one guy. It puts me in that category. The potential is there for sure.”</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Joshua’s earning power is certainly something everyone in British boxing wants to emulate too with the WBA and IBF champion pocketing around £15m every time he steps through the ropes these days.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">But, for Eubank, money is not the main motivation as he insists it is about legacy and leaving the shadow of his father, Chris Sr, who won world titles in two weight divisions.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Of course, if he beats Groves and books a place in the World Boxing Super Series final then he will be one win away from lifting the Muhammad Ali trophy and claiming the largest share of the £20m prize pot.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">“I’m not putting my health at risk and risking my livelihood for nothing,” said Eubank Jr, who has lost just one of his 27 fights.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">“There has to be some type of reward, some type of security.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">“It is important that it is there.
