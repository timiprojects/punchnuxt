petrol queues before Sunday, FG orders NNPC"},content:{rendered:'<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Okechukwu Nnodim, Abuja </strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The Federal Government on Thursday said it had directed the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation to clear the petrol queues that had refused to disappear in Abuja and neighbouring states before the commencement of the 2018 Nigeria International Petroleum Summit.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">It also stated that the Federal Ministry of Petroleum Resources and some of its agencies were working out measures that would ensure the retention of pump price of petrol at N145 per litre despite a landing cost of about N171 per litre.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, Ibe Kachikwu, told journalists at a press conference in Abuja that it would not be nice to have international guests face petrol queues in the Federal Capital Territory when they attend the 2018 NIPS, which begins on Sunday.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">He said, “As for the fuel queues that you see out there, we are working round the clock; the NNPC is also working round the clock on this. If you remember when it first started in December (2017), it was a lot more massive, but Lagos is largely fuel queue free and a lot of the state capitals are.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">“Abuja is still struggling because of some logistics issues. We’ve instructed the NNPC to do whatever it takes to ensure that I do not bring visitors here next week and they will experience fuel queues. They (NNPC) will have to do whatever it takes to get this eliminated in Abuja and that is the directive I’ll be sending to the NNPC.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">“Let them (NNPC) work night and day and put a lot more effort in trying to do this. But I can tell you that behind the scenes, a lot of meetings are taking place. This is because the fuel queue issue is both a logistics and a policy issue.”</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The minister stated that the government would need to address the fundamental policy issues to enable the queues go away, “especially in an area where the pricing puts pressure between the landing price and the sale price.”</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Kachikwu said, “So, we need to work out ways to see what we need to do to continue to sell at N145 per litre. The President is obviously very committed to keeping the price of fuel at the cost where it is. We don’t intend to increase the price again and so we need to work backwards, and this requires a lot of efficiency re-engineering.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">“So, give a bit of time, be patient, but I do take your point. I will hate it for my colleagues to come here and see fuel queues happening and so my directive for the NNPC will be whatever it takes, get those queues out of Abuja over the period.”</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">On the falling cost of crude in the international market as a result of the rising sale of shale oil, Kachikwu noted that the government was not ruffled by the development.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">He said, “In terms of the price of petroleum products, I don’t think we need to be panicky about it. We are not ruffled by it and I know it has come down to around $60 per barrel now. Shale is going to be active. Whenever we are in excess of $65, shale becomes very active.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">“But I’ve always said that two things need to happen. First, OPEC needs to just focus on itself and focus on what it needs to do and forget what is happening in shale. The second thing is that every OPEC producer must work hard to be a least cost producer. Because the truth is that if shale can be produced at $65, then there is absolutely no reason why we should be struggling.”</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">He added, “So, the fundamentals of our earnings, how efficient we are and our cost of production are the things we have to do internally.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">“There should be fundamental rejigging of production models to ensure that you get the very best. One nice thing about low prices is that they force everybody to abandon high cost of production.”</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">On refineries, Kachikwu said before the end of March this year, the government would sign the requisite contracts that would lead to the re-kitting of the facilities.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">This, however, will happen if the President gives the required approval, according to the minister.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Copyright PUNCH.</strong><strong><br />\n</strong><em>All rights reserved.

While these are two very valid points that are certainly worth people knowing by themselves, they don’t provide enough information for people to truly appreciate what they are getting into.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">To add some meat to the bones here are further details on the advantages and disadvantages of taking out a secured loan from a bank/ lender.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Advantages of secured loans</strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">*Your monthly repayments can be lowered by spreading them over a longer period of time (be aware that while this can be advantageous in the short term, it could mean you actually repay more in total interest over a longer period).</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">*If you decide to take out a secured loan rather than remortgage, you can avoid the potential problem of losing any special rates currently enjoyed on your existing mortgage deal.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">*Changing your mortgage to raise extra funds could mean facing large early repayment charges, taking out a secured loan help to avoid this.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">*A secured loan can be used for any purpose as long as it is legal, raising extra funds via a remortgage may have usage restrictions.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Disadvantages of secured loans:</strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">*The interest rates on secured loans will be higher than for a mortgage; this reflects the risk involved on the lender’s behalf, even though you, the borrower, have provided security against the capital. Another reason is the lender only has what is called a ‘second charge’ on your property.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">*If you’re planning to use your secured loan to purchase a new vehicle or ‘white good’ i.e. a washing machine you may well be left with the debt long after the usefulness of your purchases has expired.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">*The upfront costs such as valuation fees and arrangement fees will increase your expenditure.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">*Paying off your secured loan each month may leave you short of cash to meet other bills. The temptation to borrow more to meet these demands presents the very real risk of falling into a debt spiral.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">When considering the possibility of taking out a secured loan it is important to weigh up both the pros and cons to make sure you reach the right decision. If there is any doubt in your mind the best course of action is to speak with an independent financial advisor to discuss your options.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">If you feel this form of borrowing is right for you, make sure you get the best deal possible, compare your banks secured loans to scour the market for the best offers currently available.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">It’s important to remember that by taking out a secured loan, you are putting your home at risk, this is a decision you want to make with absolute confidence for your own peace of mind.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Copyright PUNCH.<br />\n</strong>All rights reserved.

unveils new incentives for non-oil exporters"},content:{rendered:'<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>&#8230;Exporters to get paid before shipment</strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>The Federal Government has rolled out a new set of incentives that will guarantee payment for exporters before shipment and stakeholders are confident it will boost non-oil exports by 150 to 300 per cent, ANNA OKON writes</strong></em></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The government has gone beyond the revival of the Export Expansion Grant incentive scheme to introduce a new basket of incentives for existing and new exporters.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">According to the Acting Executive Director/Chief Executive Officer, Nigerian Export Promotion Council, Abdullahi Sidi-Aliyu, the new basket of incentives is designed to boost the growth of the Small and Medium Enterprises sector.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Speaking during a stakeholders’ forum on the validation of the guidelines of the new incentives in Lagos on Friday, Abdullahi Sidi-Aliyu, who was represented by the Director, Export Development and Incentives at the NEPC, George Enyiekpon, revealed that the government had already made funds available for the implementation of the new incentives.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">He added that unlike the EEG, which was a post-shipment incentive where exporters were required to export before accessing, the new basket of incentives was pre-shipment and exporters would be given the grant before carrying out the export.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Sidi-Aliyu said that the NEPC had constituted a technical committee on the new basket of incentives, which reviewed export incentive schemes in the country and came up with suggestions.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">“The draft report of the committee proposed the reactivation of moribund schemes such as Export Development Fund, Export Adjustment Scheme Fund, Manufacture-In-Bond Scheme and the introduction of new ones such as Export Support/Litigation Fund, which is being presented for stakeholders’ validation,” he stated.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">He noted that the Export Incentives and Miscellaneous Provisions Act had made provision for various forms of incentives out of which only the EEG was operational, adding that it was obvious that the EEG alone was not enough to cater for all the challenges facing the non-oil sector.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">With the return of the EEG, some stakeholders including XPT Logistics International Limited expect more people to go into the export business.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer, XPT Logistics International Limited &#8211; a consultancy, training and trade facilitation firm, Mr. Kolawole Awe, specifically said the export volume would rise by about 150 per cent.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The President, Federation of Agricultural Commodities Association of Nigeria, Dr. Victor Iyama, told our correspondent that the new scheme would push up the non-oil export sector by about 300 per cent.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The Chairman, Manufacturers Association of Nigeria, Export Promotion Group, Chief Ede Dafinone, stated that with the introduction of the new incentives, there would be a remarkable growth in the non-oil export volume by the end of the first quarter of 2019.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Speaking to our correspondent on the sideline of the stakeholders’ forum in Lagos, Dafinone also expressed confidence that Nigeria was about to witness a reversal of the high unemployment rate.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">“The scheme will encourage new operators to come into the export sector and that way more jobs would be generated,” he said.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Iyama, who has been an operator in the agro-export sector for over 27 years, said, “I believe the growth of the sector will be tripled if there is consistency in the policy.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">“This policy is better than the EEG in terms of encouraging upcoming exporters who have no opportunity to access bank loans.”</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Awe said that with the widening of the basket, more people would be attracted to the non-oil export sector.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">“The export sector will grow more than 150 per cent because the EEG is back; utilisation has been expanded, you can use it to pay tax, buy treasury bills, and so on. More people will go back to export to be able to take advantage of the EEG and all the other incentives.”</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">“This is what is being practised in more developed economies and we are just taking a cue from that,” he said.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Continuing he said, “The EDF, for instance, is targeted at the SMEs that are hampered by funding capacity to expand their market. With the EDF, they have access to funds to take care of their labelling, branding, advertisement issues and more importantly to be able to access the international market.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">“So you can imagine the myriad of opportunities opened to new and existing exporters. I believe it is going to greatly impact on the figures of the non-oil export sector and the SMEs would be able to produce, sell more and employ more people and the economy will grow as a result.”</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The suspension of the EEG in 2014 led to a decline in non-oil exports by over 50 per cent. By April 2017, the non-oil exports reportedly suffered a 60 per cent decline.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Reports put the yearly loss in the sector between 2014 and 2016 at $1.39bn compared with the $3.4bn recorded in 2013.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The 2016 recession added to the suspension in the EEG to compound the loss. According to data from the National Bureau of Statistics, export trade on non-oil goods in 2016 was the lowest at about $1.1bn compared to 2011 and 2012 when receipts from  agro-based produce were  over $3.8bn and $3.9bn, respectively.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Following series of screening of outstanding claims, meetings and negotiations with stakeholders, President Muhammadu Buhari in his 2016 budget speech announced that the EEG would be revived and made provision for it in the 2017 budget.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">This, in addition to the country’s exit from recession, led to a rise in the non-oil exports to $1.26bn by the third quarter of 2017.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">It was also resolved that the backlog of the unclaimed Negotiable Duty Credit Certificates (instruments presented by exporters to enable them to benefit from payment of the EEG claims) would be settled through promissory notes.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The new basket of incentives would be claimed through the presentation of the Export Credit Certificates, which was used to replace the NDCC.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Copyright PUNCH.<br />\n</strong>All rights reserved.

So, even if you were looking to buying a N10m house, you have to find half the price to receive your keys.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">“The Centre for Affordable Housing Finance in Africa says that for an organised developer to build a house in Nigeria, the cost comes to $28,000. So, it is estimated that only about 9.7 per cent of urban households in Nigeria can afford the cheapest house; so, what then is the hope of the young person looking to own a home?”</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">According to him, one of the most important things that any government can address is housing affordability.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">“If we can make homeownership a reality in Nigeria, we will solve a great deal of our economic problems by creating a great deal of housing. We need to systematically address these problems. Homeownership will not take off until we have addressed the issue of affordability. We should help those who want to own a home to step on the escalator and move up to the point of homeownership,” Inyangete stated.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">He said one of the key components that must be addressed was housing policy for first time homeowners.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">“In most parts of the world, the first time homeowner is supported to own such a home,” he added.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Inyangete, however, stated that the process of making homeownership affordable had kicked off with the establishment of the NMRC, developed to deepen the country’s primary and secondary mortgage markets for increased home ownership by Nigerians.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The NHFP, he said was set up by the Federal Government and was being implemented by Central Bank of Nigeria with the World Bank’s International Development Association loan.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">“The NMRC’s key role is to make homeownership a reality through providing funds for mortgage lenders so they can make mortgages a reality for lenders,” he added.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">A board member of the NMRC and the Managing Director of Homebase Mortgage Bank Limited, Dr. Femi Johnson, said stakeholders were working to create an enabling environment for housing finance so that a lot of people could own their own homes and also ensure that houses were available at the right prices, while making mortgages available at the right interest rates and tenor with issues of title transfers, foreclosures and the rights of tenants protected.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">According to him, one of the steps being taken is the ‘My Own Home’ scheme being actualised through the NMRC, mortgage guarantee/insurance scheme and housing microfinance scheme components of the Nigeria Housing Finance Programme.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Johnson explained, “The first aspect of the scheme is mortgage where the NMRC plays a very active role; the second is the mortgage guarantee scheme, which is about to be launched by the Central Bank of Nigeria; it is essentially an insurance, which allows people without the minimum 20 per cent contribution to contribute five per cent and get a loan of up to 95 per cent. It is an innovative tool that is being used in other climes.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">“The other is the housing microfinance for people at the end of the ladder and is anchored by microfinance banks. It is for incremental building. ‘My Own Home’ is like an enlightenment scheme to educate people and help them understand what is available, their rights and responsibilities and all the things being done in the mortgage industry to ease the process of homeownership.”</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">He noted that there had been increased confidence in the mortgage industry through the various initiatives by stakeholders.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">“Before the NMRC, the longest loan we gave was for five years even if usually our loans were for two years; but now, we give 20-year loan as a standard and what it means is that people are not under pressure to repay so much, they can spread their repayment over a long period and more people can now afford it. The NMRC takes bonds from the market for 15 years and we lend for 20 years and such mortgages are very prevalent in the market today,” he added.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">According to Iyangete, if construction of affordable homes and the funding that will allow the realisation of cheaper mortgages to be created are encouraged, the country will be on its way to ending its housing crisis.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Copyright PUNCH.<br />\n</strong>All rights reserved.

This is because the critical factor militating against maximising the potential in the Nigerian agricultural sector is lack of processing or value addition to our farm produce. In fact, in Kogi State, there is no processing of any significant level.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">“We seek off-takers of our produce as the lack of this is another major reason for post-harvest loss in the agricultural sector. Hence, whatever we do to provide market for our finished products will go a long way.”</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">On the need for backward integration in the state, he observed that farmers in Kogi State were constrained by not only finance, but also lack of support in critical areas.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">“Companies can better secure their future by creating their own raw materials supply chain with selected farmers. This leads to efficiency in sourcing for the raw materials and economic viability arising from a reduction in cost of importation,” Bello said.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">He further stated that agriculture was the main stay of the economy of Kogi State, stressing that making agriculture a business concern and not just farming for farming sake was one of the top priorities of his administration.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Copyright PUNCH.<br />\n</strong>All rights reserved.

estate firm, Homework Development and Properties Limited, says it is working to restore the trust foreign investors once had in the Nigerian real estate industry.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The firm said the confidence that more foreign investments would come into the country came as a result of the recent conference organised by the Association of Nigerian Physicians in the Americas in Atlanta, Georgia, United States, where it showcased its affordable products and promoted the recent positive developments in the country’s real estate industry.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The Managing Director, Homework Development and Properties, Mr. Jide Adekola, said the forum provided a platform that helped to change the perception that foreign investors would not get value for money or might get scammed in Nigeria.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">He noted that it also created the awareness that there were professionals in the industry who had the capacity to provide quality products in due time.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">“The change in perception, which we have created, will in no small measure boost businesses and increase the volume of foreign direct investments that can engender increase in the Gross Domestic Product of the country,” Adekola noted.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">He said ANPA members, who had benefited from the services of the company, specifically requested that Homework should participate in the conference in order to take the Nigerian success story to the outside world.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">According to him, the event exposed his company to ANPA’s publications, increased networking and sales leads, increased trust of foreign investors in the Nigerian real estate market, and also boosted awareness that there is a unique selling point in the company’s products, which are delivered by professional architects.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">He explained that the real estate industry could grow faster if the government subsidised the cost of land for credible developers who had the capacity to provide affordable housing.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Adekola said the firm would also take part in the annual conference organised by the National Association of Nigerian Nurses in North America and other subdivisions within the United States.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">“This will enable the company to reach out to other professional associations and more Nigerians in the globe. Homework is also planning to hold similar exhibitions and talks in Canada, the United Kingdom and other countries with large population of Nigerians,” he said.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Copyright PUNCH.<br />\n</strong>All rights reserved.

The power and energy got N1.85tn; construction, N2.56tn; trade and general commerce, N3.89tn, while the credit to government was put at N3tn.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">In the same vein, the real estate sector received a total loan of N3.13tn; finance, insurance; and capital market, N3.89tn; education, N310bn; information and communications, N3.2tn; transportation and storage, N1.55tn while other sectors got N1.47tn.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">A former President, Abuja Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Mr. Tony Ejinkeonye, called on the Central Bank of Nigeria to reduce the Cash Reserves Ratio and the Liquidity Ratio in order to free up more funds for banks to provide the much needed credit to the real sector.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The CRR is a certain percentage of the total bank deposits that has to be kept in the vault of the apex bank, and the banks do not have access to that amount for any economic activity.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The CRR is currently pegged at 22.5 per cent; liquidity ratio at 30 per cent; and the Asymmetric Window at +200 and -500 basis points around the Monetary Policy Rate, which is 14 per cent.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">He said the call for a reduction was based on the conviction that the ability of banks to create money or extend credit to businesses had been stifled, having exceeded the 80 per cent loan-to-deposit regulatory threshold.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Ejinkeonye said even at the high prevailing interest rate, access to finance to the real sector had remained subdued due to attractive risk-free lending to government to fund its budget deficit.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">He said, “We have noticed that the ability of banks to create money or extend credit to businesses is stifled, having exceeded the 80 per cent loan-to-deposit regulatory threshold.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">“Even at the high prevailing interest rate, access to finance to the real sector will remain subdued owing to attractive risk-free lending to government to fund its budget deficit.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">“In view of the above, we recommend a downward review of the Cash Reserve Ratio and the liquidity ratio to enable deposit money banks to create money and increase credit facility to the real sector. While this is sine qua non at this time, the apex bank must first raise its regulatory or oversight efficiency to forestall systemic risk that could be necessitated by high non-performing loan and poor capital adequacy ratio.”</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">According to him, inflationary pressure poses greater threat to businesses, adding that the current high inflation rate though decelerating is structurally induced.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">In view of this, he said fiscal instruments to improve business conditions and critical infrastructure such as roads, rail and power are needed to stimulate investment in the near to medium term.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Copyright PUNCH.</em><br />\n</strong>All rights reserved.

She speaks about her interest in finance</em></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>What stirred your interest in the finance sector?</em></strong>My first job after I completed the National Youth Service Corps programme was in a management consulting company where I worked as a business analyst. I became interested in solving business problems and having a good knowledge of financial statements.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>You have a keen interest in investment. Why is this so?</em></strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">At some point in my career, I realised that even though I had worked for over four years, I had no significant savings. That realisation helped me begin to learn how to save. It also led me to start an investment club with four friends.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>What is your educational background?</em></strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">I have a bachelor’s degree in Economics from the Lagos State University, Ojo, and a master’s degree in Business Administration from the Lagos Business School.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>You also have a website that teaches people how to manage their finances. Can you shed more light on this?</em></strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">I started my website to teach people about my practical investment experience and how different investment options work. Then, I started getting a lot of emails and requests from people to explain more complex investment terms and how investment clubs work. I started doing a lot of research and I reached out to experts to learn more so I could share the insights on my website. Over time, I have held several workshops and developed online courses to teach financial education and to make people aware of available investment options. I also work with corporate clients that build web and mobile applications that drive financial inclusion.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>When did you launch the website and how much was your start-up capital?</em></strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">I started my website in 2016. It did not require any start-up capital because I built the website myself.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>You are also a partner at Midas Capital. What do you do there?</em></strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Midas Capital is an investment club that I co-founded with four of my friends. We incorporated the club to become a legal entity and we contribute funds towards investing in different asset classes, and building wealth.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>You were a business analyst at Alliance Consulting Nigeria. What did the job entail?</em></strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">My job as a business analyst entails a lot of economic research, analysis and project work. Some of the projects I worked on involved writing business plans, staff audit projects, due diligence exercises, among others.  One major project I worked on, prior to leaving to do my MBA, was a staff audit project to restructure the longest surviving indigenous bank in Nigeria with total assets worth $1.4bn. The bank was successfully restructured, survived the banking crisis in 2009 and is currently competitive in the banking industry.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Who are your role models and how have they influenced you?</em></strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">I have different role models for different areas of my life. I have spiritual role models, business role models, parenting role models, and others. I decided to have different role models because I realised that making one person a role model would be a burden. All my role models have influenced me directly in their defined spheres of influence. They have helped me think bigger, focus on achieving more and empowering people I come in direct contact with.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>What is your work objective?</em></strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">My work object is to make investing simple for every Nigerian.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>How would you advise young people who want to excel in their various careers?</em></strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">What you focus on expands. Focus on becoming more than you are today or achieving more than you have achieved. Nigeria needs more people to step out and solve its problems. Each of us in our individual way can make a difference. Secondly, life begins when you step out of your comfort zone. Get comfortable with being uncomfortable. Nobody grows in a comfort zone. Give yourself the opportunity to grow by making bolder choices. Finally, when you earn, set aside a percentage for investment. When you invest, you put your money to work. If you keep doing that, eventually your money will outwork you and you can achieve financial freedom.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Copyright PUNCH.</em><br />\n</strong>All rights reserved.

In this interview with <strong>FEYISAYO POPOOLA</strong>, he says though there may be challenges, he finds fulfilment as an entrepreneur</em></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Tell us about Media Panache.</em></strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em> </em></strong>Media Panache Nigeria is a public relations and digital marketing firm founded in 2016. We serve both individuals and organisations in community, government, and media relations.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em> How did it start?</em></strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em> </em></strong>The company’s journey has been quite a riveting one. I founded Media Panache in March 2016 shortly after exiting my previous place of work. With the ample knowledge I had procured in the field, I visualised and put together a PR agency with a young and vibrant team that would exert unique approaches in the execution of creative PR ideas.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"> We initially started on a WhatsApp group, attending to clients and setting projects in motion thereon – before moving into an office space situated in Ikeja, Lagos.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>What motivated you to start up your own business?</em></strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em> </em></strong>My passion is the driving force behind the company’s existence. I built it upon my passion. Also, I identified a number of things the Nigerian PR industry is currently lacking and one of my long-term goals is to provide long-lasting solutions – hence, making a formidable impact on a general scale.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em> How much was your initial capital and how did you raise it?</em></strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em> </em></strong>My initial capital was about N200, 000. It was a challenging moment as I had just left my previous place of work &#8211; making the conscious decision to float my own company, and knowing apparently, the amount might not suffice.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em> </em></strong>However, with the unyielding support, love and encouragement from my loved ones, I was able to pull through, and the rest is history. This serves as a reminder that one shouldn’t be easily discouraged from actualising set goals – not even by financial constraints.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em> What was your work experience prior to starting your business,?</em></strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em> </em></strong>I worked as a public relations executive at Black House Media from 2014 to 2016. There, I was entrusted with the responsibility of responding to clients’ briefs. I was responsible for evolving strategic PR plans to address their needs and meet their set goals and objectives through the execution of carefully prepared plans.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em> Do you find fulfilment in what you do?</em></strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Absolutely! Nothing supersedes passion in regards to professionalism. PR has always been my ingrained passion. I find the entire spectrum incredibly gripping and I couldn’t be happier that my passion was ignited through practicing it. We (Media Panache) currently have a considerable clientele; spanning across corporate and entertainment industry.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em> Your organisation recently won an award; how did that make you feel?</em></strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em> </em></strong>It made me feel appreciated and it made my team’s efforts since the company’s inception feel acknowledged. Honestly, I didn’t see the nomination coming. We were barely a year as at the time of the awards. It served as an indication that our works had not been going unnoticed. It was a real confidence booster.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>What are the major challenges you’ve faced?</em></strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">One of the major downsides that come with being a young agency is being undervalued by established organisations. Several companies don’t trust emerging PR agencies with their marketing briefs or the execution of campaigns.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Some would rather seek the services of the top guns; the more established agencies. In reality, the truth is those constantly underestimated values of young agencies are the key to the services many of these organisations hanker for, and also the future of the PR industry.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em> What is your staff strength?</em></strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Currently, my team consists of 11 full-time employees and seven contract staff.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Has there ever been anytime you thought of quitting and seeking paid employment?</em></strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em> </em></strong>No, I haven’t considered that before and I don’t think I would. I’m satisfied with my job; I enjoy being Media Panache MD.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em> Is your business registered with the Corporate Affairs Commission?</em></strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em> </em></strong>Of course, we are. That’s one of the first and most basic steps in establishing a business officially.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em> How do you get your clients?</em></strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em> </em></strong>We get clients lot of times through referrals from our satisfied customers. They recommend our services to other individuals or organisations seeking the services of an astute PR agency. Other times, we get clients through our tailored contents on social media. We also accentuate our company as a brand through campaigns and through traditional media vehicles and channels.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em> How profitable is the business?</em></strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em> </em></strong>PR is a lucrative business; however, it isn’t one of the most flourishing in this part of the world yet. I believe there is a lot of room for it to be.  Perhaps, if more organisations start trusting and investing in the effectiveness of PR like in developed countries, then it would undoubtedly become one of the most profitable engagements.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em> Have there been any complaints from clients so far?</em></strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em> </em></strong>In a business like PR where customer relations is incredibly consequential, it is your duty to identify errors before your clients do and provide solution as well as preventive measures to curb reoccurrence.  Keeping countermeasure readily available is one of the ways to professionally handle customer displeasure.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em> What would you say is the most influential factor in your business’ success?</em></strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em> </em></strong>The drive, the passion, and the zeal to excel</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em> What is your educational background?</em></strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em> </em></strong>I had my secondary education at Lagos State Model College, Meiran. I graduated from Lagos State University, Ojo,  in 2012 with a bachelor’s degree in theatre arts.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em> What other skills do you possess?</em></strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em> </em></strong>I possess excellent customer service skills as well as multi-tasking, digital marketing, public speaking, team work, and flexibility skills</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em> Where do you see yourself and your business in the next five years?</em></strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em> </em></strong>I see myself leading my team to awe-inspiring levels of achievements professionally whilst making a significant impact in Nigeria’s PR industry – setting standards for practitioners nationwide. I see Media Panache at the pinnacle of Africa’s Public Relations sphere in the next five years. It’s definitely one of our long-term goals; one we would work unflaggingly to accomplish.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em> Do you think there is any hope for entrepreneurship in Nigeria?</em></strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em> </em></strong>The world is ever-evolving. Things have changed, and so have perceptions especially in this contemporary age we are in. The advent of social media has opened a myriad of possibilities, and I believe several parents can perceive this today.  I truly believe there is hope for entrepreneurship.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em> If you had one piece of advice to someone just starting out, what would it be?</em></strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong> </strong>Keep your head above water; never lose focus, and remain steadfast and undeterred through challenges and moments of trepidation. Remember, there is only one person that can preclude you from actualising your set goals; and that’s yourself.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Copyright PUNCH.</em><br />\n</strong>All rights reserved.

He shares his experience with <strong>OLUFEMI ATOYEBI</strong></em></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Where did you spend your childhood?</em></strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">I was raised in the Mapo area of Ibadan, Oyo State. I spent most of my formative years in the area before I left the country to study abroad.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"> <strong><em>Which schools did you attend in Nigeria?</em></strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">I attended Christ Church School at Mapo/Odinjo and Victory School, Oke-Ado, Ibadan for my elementary study. For my secondary and A-level education, I attended Government College, Ibadan from 1963 to 1969 under the old western region scholarship.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Following the completion of my secondary and A-level education, I applied for and received a direct admission to study Mathematics at the then University of Ife (now Obafemi Awolowo University) in 1970.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"> <strong><em>Which course did you study?</em></strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The school at that time did not have engineering course. It had Electronics Technology and Chemical Technology. I was not interested in either of them. Besides Ife, only Ahmadu Bello University and the University of Lagos offered engineering courses. University of Ibadan did not have engineering course. The University of Nigeria, Nsukka campus had been destroyed by the Nigerian civil war that ended in 1970.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Since my interest had always been in Mechanical Engineering, I did not enrol at Ife. I moved to the US in January 1971 and enrolled at the California State University where in June of 1974, I received a Bachelor of Science degree in Mechanical Engineering.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Later that year, I enrolled at the Aerospace and Mechanical Engineering Department at the University of Arizona and in 1975, I received a master’s degree in probabilistic structural analysis.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">I returned to California to attend University of Southern California where I received another master’s degree in Applied Mechanics in 1977. I later obtained a doctoral degree in a non-traditional programme at California Coast University in 1983 and a Master of Business Administration certificate in 1988 from California State University.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"> <strong><em>What inspired your choice of career?</em></strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The desire to understand how an airplane can stay off the ground was a great inspiration in my decision to choose Engineering as a course of study. More than 100 years after the discovery of the airplane by the Wright brothers, a lot of people are still afraid to fly because it’s difficult for them to understand how such a heavy chunk of metal can stay in the air.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"> <strong><em>If you had not been an aeronautical engineer, what other profession would you have considered?</em></strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Actually, my first full time professional job in the US was in construction, at the power division of Bechtel Corporation. I was there between 1978 and 1986. I needed to satisfy some other legal requirements to get into the aerospace industry.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Bechtel sponsored me for the resident visa. I needed to acquire the US citizenship to get into the aerospace industry. This took some time. Long ago, I was fascinated with the Banker’s outfit and thought I might be an accountant, but that didn’t last long.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"> <strong><em>What has been your experience as an aeronautical engineer?</em></strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">I have been associated with my current employer &#8211; Lockheed Martin Corporation &#8211; since 2001 when I started in its Aeronautics Division as an aeronautical engineer in the Structural Analysis Department assigned first to the F16 and later the F35, the Joint Strike Fighter.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Lockheed Martin is the largest defence contractor in the US.  The group is tasked with the responsibility of ensuring the aircraft can sustain all the forces imposed on it during flight from take-off to landing.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">In 2010, I moved to the company’s Helicopter Division, Sikorsky Aircraft, to get some helicopter experience. Sikorsky Aircraft is the world’s number one helicopter manufacturer, well known for its Black Hawk. Sikorsky also has its line of commercial models – the S76 and S92 – which are used by oil companies for their offshore and executive transportation, both of which I worked on before moving to Black Hawk which I am currently on. Sikorsky also boasts of building the Marine One. I find my job as an aeronautical engineer very fulfilling.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Prior to Lockheed Martin, I had worked at Raytheon Aircraft, Rockwell International, where I worked on the space shuttle; Boeing, McDonald Douglass and Gulfstream. Rockwell International and McDonald Douglass have since been acquired by Boeing. My first entry into the aerospace industry was in 1987 at Rockwell International Space Division. Rockwell built the B-1 Bomber.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"> <strong><em>How did you develop interest in aircraft?</em></strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">My interest in aircraft dates back to when I was growing up as a kid questioning in my mind how such a big chunk of metal can stay up in the air.  The principle of flight is as simple as air flowing over the wings to effect and maintain lift.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>What is aeronautical engineering all about?</em></strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Aeronautical engineering is primarily about developing an aircraft or spacecraft through application of engineering principles. Developing an aircraft requires understanding of aerodynamic load and the structural effect of the load on the vehicle air frame.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The air frame has to be strong enough to withstand the load. My area of speciality is structural design and analysis.  All the structural elements and components are thoroughly evaluated for strength and all other failure modes.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Like I said earlier, it’s been over 100 years since the Wright brothers discovered the aeroplane but a lot of people are afraid to fly because they cannot understand how such big object can stay in the air.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">A former US president was so afraid of the plane that he would not travel by air until he became governor, and that was with a lot of persuasion. The basic theory behind flight is air flowing over the wings to create lift.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The bigger the wings, the more the volume of air flowing over them and the more the lift capability. In the helicopters (or the rotor crafts as we call them in the industry), the blades represent the wings. The basic difference between the fixed wing aircraft (or airplane as is commonly known) and the rotor craft is that the regular airplane has to keep moving to stay off the ground, whereas the helicopter can lift up and stay up without moving.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Helicopters are useful in search and rescue. However, helicopters suffer from altitude, range and speed limitations. The maximum speed is about 175 knots (or 200mph) at a maximum altitude of about 1,0000ft or 3,050m. In comparison, the fixed wing can attain altitude of more than 3,5000ft or 1,0668m and travel at a speed of more than 400mph or 645kph.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>How easy or difficult was it for you to master the profession?</em></strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Transitioning from the construction industry, I had to make some adjustments because the design philosophies and requirements are different. The engineering principles are the same, just the design philosophy. With construction, since the project is staying on the ground, weight is not as much of a concern as in the aircraft that has to stay in the air.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>What are the major considerations during the design of an aircraft?</em></strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The aircraft needs to be as light as possible without sacrificing safety. We have to carefully strike a balance between weight and safety. There are also slight differences between military and commercial aircraft. While safety is important for both, performance is paramount in the military; so here again you strike a balance between safety and performance without sacrificing one for the other. The spacecraft is a different thing altogether. In this profession, one is always learning.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Are you the only Nigerian in the profession working in the US?</em></strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">No, I am not the only Nigerian in the profession in the US.  There are quite a few of us in different areas. Here at Lockheed Martin/Sikorsky, I am the only one in my specialty area, structures.  There used to be another guy from Kogi State, but he left about a year ago.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Structures or Stress Analysis is one area where the Aerospace industry generally experience shortages. There are two other Nigerians in Materials – a female engineer from Rivers State and a guy from Imo State. They work closely with the manufacturing assembly group. There used to be another guy in Manufacturing Engineering. Manufacturing engineers work closely with the Shop Assembly. There are other Nigerians with other companies.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>As an aeronautical engineer, do you go to war zones to render service?</em></strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">No, we do not go to war fronts because we are not part of the military. We do get reports on how well our products are performing. There is no need for us to go war zones.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Copyright PUNCH.</em><br />\n</strong>All rights reserved.

unprecedented hike in food prices soon as a result of the incessant conflicts between farmers and herders, <strong>Okechukwu Nnodim</strong> reports</em></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The clashes between farmers and herdsmen in different parts of the country will definitely lead to a hike in food prices any time soon if not addressed, agricultural professionals and civil society have warned.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">According to them, some parts of the country are already experiencing a hike in the cost of agricultural commodities, a development caused by the continued clashes between herdsmen and farmers in different communities.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">They stated that the recurrent conflicts between herdsmen and farmers had led to the abandonment of various farmlands across the country, adding that crop production had reduced in Nigeria, particularly in the past three months.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Farmers also told our correspondent that they had stopped dry season farming due to the attacks unleashed on crop producers by marauding armed herdsmen.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">It was learnt that the production of crops such as cassava and some vegetables in some states in Nigeria had reduced, as producers of these commodities now steer clear of farmlands for fear of being maimed or killed by herders.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">CSOs as well as practitioners in the agricultural sector stated that Nigeria may experience food crisis because many farmers in food producing states were now afraid of going to their farms.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">They observed that farmers were now fleeing their farmlands, while some others now go to their respective farms in groups as they dread herdsmen.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Civil society organisations stated that the arms-bearing Fulani herdsmen operating in Nigeria had succeeded in unleashing terror attacks in no fewer than 12 states across the country.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The states include Benue, Taraba, Adamawa, Plateau, Edo, Kogi, Ondo, Enugu, Nasarawa, Ekiti, Rivers and Cross Rivers states, among others.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The different organisations that spoke to our correspondent in Abuja include the International Action Network on Small Arms, NINGONET for Humanitarian Development Response Initiative, as well as Adinya Arise Foundation.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">A board member of NINGONET, Tim Aniebonam, said, “We have observed with dismay, the spread of violent attacks by herdsmen across Nigeria and particularly on Benue, Taraba, Adamawa, Plateau, Edo, Kogi, Ondo, Enugu and Nasarawa states. Many lives have been lost and farmlands destroyed and set ablaze as a result of wanton killings and activities of the herdsmen, leaving community members displaced.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">“These herdsmen have grown into monsters who regularly rape women and female children they come across in the farms and bushes with people no longer able to move about freely. This has made many to flee their farmlands and very soon the result will be a sharp hike in food prices across the country.”</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">He added, “The attacks by herdsmen are also causing a wave in the South-South region of the country as lives have been lost and many displaced from communities in Rivers and Cross River states, leading to a growing number of displaced persons in Nigeria.”</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Also, different groups of farmers told our correspondent that if the Federal Government fails to call the herdsmen to order, their activities may not only warrant hike in food prices, but might lead to food scarcity in Nigeria.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The Chairman, All Farmers Association of Nigeria, Otunba Femi Oke, stated that farmers across the country were not happy with what is going on in Nigeria as regards the clashes between crop producers and herdsmen.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">He urged the government to take the policy on agro-rangers seriously, as farmers need to be protected from rampaging herdsmen if they (farmers) must produce food for the country.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Oke said, “We are not happy at the moment and we want this problem not to repeat itself because most of our farmers cannot feed themselves anymore. Many of them have fled and left their farmlands because of the activities of herdsmen. This can lead to food crisis any time from now if it is not addressed. Of course, it will lead to a hike in food prices as well.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">“But I must mention that we are all one and I pray the crisis do not repeat itself as seen in the past. The policy on agro-rangers can also help; we want to see it implemented adequately in order to curb all the clashes and menace we experience across the country.”</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Also commenting on the development, the President, Nigeria Cassava Growers Association, Mr. Segun Adewumi, said the killings by armed herdsmen had made farmers to go to farms in groups and warned of an imminent hike in food prices.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">He, however, stated that some locations in Nigeria were already experiencing a hike in the cost of agricultural produce.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Adewumi said, “I have the fear of an imminent food crisis in Nigeria if the clashes between herdsmen and farmers continue. I say this because in our own case as cassava farmers, right now many people are afraid to go to their farmlands. Some now go to their farms in groups, but are still afraid of being attacked. Is this supposed to be so?</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">“In Ekiti, for instance,  a woman was killed some days ago by herdsmen. We also heard of killings in Plateau State. And when farmers go in groups, they are afraid because they know that the attackers can come with sophisticated weapons and guns. So right now, people are afraid to go to farms in various states that I know and this may lead to food scarcity if nothing is done about it.”</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The Network Coordinator, IANSA, Mimidoo Achakpa, stated that the lack of haste in addressing the issue and poor proactive response had further worsened the crisis.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Achakpa said, “The network wish to draw public attention to humanitarian crisis in war torn countries and North-East and wonder if Nigeria and indeed West Africa would be able to accommodate Nigerian refugees in their numbers should this crisis escalate beyond its current scope.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The Coordinator, Nigeria Agribusiness Group, Mr. Emmanuel Ijewere, said the Federal Government must make herdsmen know their limits, stressing that they were also in business with other businessmen and women across the country.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">He said, “Cattle rearing is a business like poultry, piggery and others. If one person’s business becomes a problem to somebody else’s business, the government should intervene to ensure that everybody knows where their own right starts and ends. That is basically the situation here and we should remove politics from it.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">“There will be food crisis both ways if the clashes are not brought under control. However, I do not think that the crop crisis will be as imminent as the lack of beef. This is because a lot of beef comes from the Northern part of Nigeria to the Southern part.”</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Ijewere added, “What will happen is that these clashes and the distraught will lead to a situation where the supply chain will be broken. Then meat will become a scarce commodity. As for the crop farmers, I know they will suffer it badly, but it is not as if 90 per cent of farms in Nigeria are being eaten up by cows.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">“But it is very terrible when herdsmen get to your farm because this will definitely have its impact on food production in Nigeria. However, can we say half the farms in Nigeria are in danger of herdsmen attacks? Mind you, I am not in any way saying that their (herdsmen) attacks won’t affect crop production across the country.”</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">On her part, the National Coordinator, NINGONET, Josephine Habba, stated that the alleged involvement of serving and retired military, police and security officers in cattle business had contributed greatly to the crisis.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">She said, “Sources observed that these security officers were in the habit of hiring Malians, Nigeriens and Chadians as herders. These foreign herders, not accustomed to the culture of Nigerian herders, are hostile to communities and because many of them are dislodged fighters in their respective countries, they are prone to bearing arms.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">“The violent foreign herders have also been fingered as teaching Nigerian herdsmen to carry arms. These arms are reported to have been supplied by employers of the herdsmen.”</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Habba urged the Federal Government to ensure that security forces were reinforced to protect lives generally in Nigeria because both farmers and herders were victims as herdsmen had been victims of alien herdsmen or rustlers.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">She added, “The state police should be decentralised. Serving and retired military and police officers who own cattle should be profiled and documented. Serving military and police top brass should be stopped from owning cattle.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">“It at all, they should be subjected to full security profile and must subject their herdsmen to security checks. All of the security personnel involved in cattle business should be registered and the military and police personnel should be directed to provide ranches for their cattle.”</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Commenting on the matter, the Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development, Chief Audu Ogbeh, said he was grieved and seriously concerned about the fatal dimension that the herders/crop farmers’ crises had taking but assured that the Federal Government would solve the problem.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">He said this in a statement made available to our correspondent in Abuja on Friday by the Federal Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">He said, “We didn’t envisage how much high voltage emotion and politicking this issue has generated. I know that the average herdsman is more concerned about the number of his herds than perhaps the milk coming out, the speed the cattle can grow and the value of the meat, which is why he needs education. More than this, we also have the leaders, the politicians; we all need education on this.”</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">According to Ogbeh, government’s proposal to set up cattle colonies and the encouragement of ranches were the best options to the killings and the toxic hatred that the current altercation was generating.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Copyright PUNCH.</em><br />\n</strong>All rights reserved.

shops for N73bn to distribute unutilised 2,000MW power"},content:{rendered:'<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Okechukwu Nnodim</strong></em></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">A total of N73bn is required for investment in the power sector in order to effectively unlock and distribute the unutilised 2,000 megawatts of electricity being generated by power producers across the country.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">According to the latest minutes of the 23rd monthly meeting of the Minister of Power, Works and Housing, Babatunde Fashola, with operators of the power sector, the N73bn investment would enable power distribution companies to adequately distribute the 2,000MW to customers.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">According to the Federal Ministry of Power, Works and Housing, Nigeria currently has a power generation capacity of about 7,000MW, but less than 5,000MW is being distributed by the electricity distribution companies.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Fashola had at several meetings called on manufacturers and other large-scale users of electricity to come forward with locations where they required more power in order to enable the government to channel some of the 2,000MW to them.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The 12-page minutes obtained by our correspondent from the FMPWH in Abuja on Friday also stated that out of the N73bn investment, N57.9bn was needed for the procurement of equipment while N15.2bn would be used for logistics.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">A director from the power arm of the FMPWH informed the meeting that a draft memo on the framework for implementing investments at the 33/11/0.415kV voltage levels of the Discos to unlock the unutilised 2,000MW in the grid had been forwarded to Fashola for consideration.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">“She noted that of the N73bn investment required, about N57.9bn was needed to procure equipment while N15.2bn would serve as cost of transportation and logistics,” the document stated.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">It also stated, “He (Fashola) appealed to manufacturers to provide information on locations where they require more power as the ministry was working on a policy to expand the distribution networks of the Discos to distribute the 2,000MW of unutilised power in the grid.”</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Fashola, who chaired the meeting, however, stated that there was improvement in power generation capability from 3,000MW in May 2015 to 7,000MW in 2017.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">He said the sector recorded improvement in transmission capacity from 5,000MW in May 2015 to 6,900MW in 2017, adding that the industry had seen improvement in peak distribution from 2,690MW in 2015 to about 5,222MW on December 18, 2017.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">On payments to the power sector for services rendered during the period under review, the document stated that the Market Operator’s report showed that Yola Disco made 100 per cent payment, while Eko Disco made 80 per cent payment.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The MO stated that operators who failed to comply with the settlement calendar would be penalised.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Reacting to this, Fashola stated that the issue of non-remittance to the MO was entirely contractual and regulatory and should be taken up by the Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">On debts owed power distributors by the Ministries, Departments and Agencies of government, the minister stated that the lasting solution was for each Disco to embark on a verification of the debts in collaboration with the state governments and ensure that they jointly signed off the result obtained to commit them to the exercise.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Copyright PUNCH.</em><br />\n</strong>All rights reserved.

Mbadugha, accused the judge of “encouraging lawlessness.”</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The lawyer’s outburst followed an enquiry by the judge, Justice Mojisola Dada, about the whereabouts of Chukwuma, who was not in court.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The lawyer had begun by saying he had several preliminary applications which must first be ironed out.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">But the judge observed that Chukwuma and the first defendant were not in court, asking, “Where are your clients?”</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Hardly had the judge finished asking the question when Mbadugha flared up.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">“These proceedings are a clear abuse of court processes; the EFCC is a reckless arbiter. My Lord should not encourage lawlessness.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">“My Lord has refused to be bound by the rule of law and doesn’t want to be bound by the doctrine of stare decisis; My Lord wants to override the decision of the Supreme Court,” Mbadugha said angrily.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The judge, who was caught by surprise, remarked, “You are insulting the court; this is a clear contempt in the face of the court; you will go to prison from here. If you think the court is defenceless and powerless, you’d be surprised.”</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">“If My Lord cites me for contempt, I will go for it,” Mbudugba replied unrepentantly.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">“Are you aware that you can go to prison from here?” The judge asked in a voice laced with threat.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Mbudugha was, however, sobered a little and began apologising.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">“My Lord, I apologise. I will never disrespect the court,” he said.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">“But your whole comportment, conduct and countenance smack of disrespect for the court and the rule of law! I refuse to listen to you, professor in what? Go back to the classroom. No wonder the kind of students being churned out of our universities with the kind of professors we have in Nigeria now,” the judge retorted.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">“I am very sorry, My Lord. To err is human, to forgive is divine. This will never repeat itself,” Mbadugba said.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">But the judge, who was not pacified, continued, “You were almost unstoppable; saying the court was not abiding by the rule of law, that’s a very serious one. I think I will report you to the NBA,” Justice Dada said.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Mbadugha apologised again and resumed his attempt to introduce his applications, but the judge said, “I refuse to listen to you. Professor in what? Disrespecting the court and encouraging your client to dishonour the court, an institution.”</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">At this point, counsel for the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, Mr. A.B.C. Ozioko, rose to his feet to address the court, but Mbadugba asked Ozioko to remain seated as “I am still on my feet.”</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The judge intervened by asking Ozioko to sit, noting that Mbadugha, being a professor, was Ozioko’s teacher and senior but Ozioko swiftly replied, “He’s not a professor of Law. He shouldn’t be coming to say he is a professor of Law. He is a professor of Animal Science!”</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">But Mbadugba protested, saying, “I am a professor of Law. I am a professor of International Arbitration.”</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">“International Arbitration? Then you shouldn’t be announcing yourself as a professor in court,” the judge said.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Eventually, Ozioko took the floor, telling the court to hold that Chukwuma had disrespected the court on the encouragement of Mbadugha.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The EFCC lawyer noted that Chukwuma had earlier in the week dragged the anti-graft agency before the Senate, proceedings which he personally attended.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">“They had respect for the National Assembly but not the court. My friend is a lawyer; he wants to diminish the integrity of this court. There is no law that says because you are challenging the charges, you should not be in court,” Ozioko said.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">He urged the judge to issue a bench warrant, particularly against Chukwuma.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">In a short ruling, Justice Dada issued a bench warrant against Chukwuma, holding that the businessman should be kept in the prison custody till March 14.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"> ”<strong>Copyright PUNCH.</strong><strong><br />\n</strong><em>All rights reserved.

This brings the total number of new Internet users to 7,117 million.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Stakeholders in the industry have warned of depleting revenue due to increased usage of Over-the-Top Internet voice applications such as Whatsapp, Skype, Telegram and FaceBook Messenger that offer instant messaging and voice calls to subscribers globally.

John Ojikutu (retd.), has called for an audit of all airport personnel in view of recent reports of aircraft invasion at Lagos airport.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">A domestic carrier, Air Peace, on Thursday night delayed a flight to Abuja after the pilot discovered that the cargo hold had been tampered with.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Ojikutu told our correspondent that only an insider with the knowledge of aircraft compartment could have attempted to break into it.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">He added, “We have to start looking inwards; there are so many people at the airport, especially those at the airside that are not supposed to be there. There are people who have been disengaged but still go about with their pass. So it is difficult to differentiate them from those who are still engaged.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">“The airport is too porous and like I have always said, the Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria, the airlines and even the ground handling companies need to come together to work on this audit.”</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The Corporate Communications Manager of Air Peace, Mr. Chris Iwarah, who confirmed the Thursday night incident, said it happened at about 7:35pm.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">He said, “We are sincerely grateful to all our wonderful guests on board Flight 7138 for their support, patience and cooperation throughout the precautionary security checks conducted by Explosive Ordinance Disposal squad, FAAN Aviation Security and our security team after suspected thieves opened the cargo hold of our aircraft holding for departure on Runway 18R (A1) of the Murtala Muhammed Airport, Lagos at about 7.35pm on Thursday, February 08, 2018.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">“The pilot, Capt. Adesola Arasi, had to contact control tower when he was alerted by the light that came on in the cockpit, suggesting that the cargo hold was opened for about 15 seconds and immediately shut. In line with our high security standards and the huge value we place on the lives of our guests and crew, Capt. Arasi insisted on having EOD squad check on Flight APK 7138 before takeoff to be doubly sure nothing was deposited in the cargo hold by the suspected thieves to endanger the lives of our guests and crew.”</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">He said the flight eventually took off at 9.30pm and safely landed in Abuja at about 10.23pm.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Ojikutu said stealing from aircraft, which was common in the 1990s, was returning and should be checked, adding that a new perimeter fence should be built as the current one was too low and porous.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">“This type of incident is very common on the 18 Right because it is close to the very porous perimeter fence and hidden from the operational people, and except they have a secondary perimeter fence, the incident may continue. FAAN should organise itself, go round the fence and figure out what happens there too,” he said.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Meanwhile, the FAAN’s General Manager, Corporate Affairs, Mrs. Henrietta Yakubu, has said the agency has set up a committee to look into recent security breaches at the airport.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Yakubu told our correspondent that the committee, made up of all the security agencies at the airport, would come up with a report that would help in solving problems of safety and security.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Copyright PUNCH.</strong><strong><br />\n</strong><em>All rights reserved.

If applying for a mortgage to buy a property, and you are rejected for the loan, it can be a heartbreaking experience.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">At some point in our lives, many of us are going to need to borrow money for something. It may be to buy a car, buy a house, or even consolidate some accounts together to reduce the interest rates, and monthly payments.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Getting a secured loan can be easier in some instances due to the fact there is something securing the loan; there is collateral securing the loan. If the agreed payments are not paid, the lender has something they can take back.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Unsecured loans have no collateral, and as such can be more difficult to qualify for. You apply for the loan, and if approved the lender gives you the money. The lender has nothing to take back should you not pay, and would need to use other collection methods to get paid.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">With some unsecured loans and open lines of credit, such as with credit cards, you can use the loan for whatever purpose you wish.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">According to <em>www.buddyloans.com,</em> there are a few things you can do to improve your chances of getting a loan approved.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Follow these tips and your odds will improve, especially if you have bad credit.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Review your credit history</strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">One of your first ports of call in order to improve your chances of being approved for a loan is to review your credit report. The Central Bank of Nigeria has approved at least three credit bureau companies in Nigeria for the purpose of producing credit reports for individuals and companies.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">You need to know what is on the report and also what your credit score is. Your credit score is used by lenders, in part, to determine as to if they will grant your loan or not.  The higher your credit score, the better your chances of having your loan approved.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">You also need to look for any errors or erroneous information on your credit history. If there is something there that is incorrect, or should not be there, you need to have it corrected.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">You can correct errors on your credit report in two ways. You can contact the creditor that has reported the account that has the error, and request they investigate and correct the error, or you can contact the credit bureau themselves to investigate the error.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">If there is something on your credit report that you need to address, not an error, but some circumstance that caused an issue, you can have a Notice of Correction placed on your credit report.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">It is important to check your credit history from time-to-time to know what is there.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Check eligibility</strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">In reviewing your credit report and credit score, and applying for a loan, one of the factors that affect your credit score is how many searches, or inquiries there are on your credit report. Too many of these searches will reduce your credit score, which is bad. Although some credit bureaus will now allow similar searches within a 24 to 48 hour period. Meaning if you are applying for the same type of loan and apply at a few lenders, all the searches are lumped together as the bureau knows you are shopping around.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">So how can you find out if you stand a chance at getting a loan without applying for the loan? Eligibility calculators, that is how.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">These calculators ask various information from you and will check your eligibility without affecting your credit score, and without placing a search on your credit report.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Documentation</strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Some lenders may request additional documents from you in order to underwrite or process your loan application.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">If you have wage statements nearby, bank statements, monthly bills, and even a detailed income and expense sheet prepared, it can make the process go smoother and quicker.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Even though the bank or lender may go through an income and expenditure check with you, at least you will have all the figures and documents at hand.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Show affordability</strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">This is not just being able to show you can afford the loan through income and expenses and wage statements, but stay within your means.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">If you are consolidating a couple of credit cards and the balances total N300,000  then request a loan for N300,000. Requesting a higher amount, especially without being able to show why you are requesting that amount, could cause the loan to be rejected.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Choose the right loan</strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">You need to choose the right loan for what you are looking to borrow for. Some people choose guarantor loans.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Obviously if you want to finance a car, going to specific lender that specialises in car loans is going to make the process easier and improve your chances of being approved.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">You also need to have a good reason for the loan. Lenders will ask you, what is the loan for?</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Requesting a loan to go on holiday, or using a short-term loan for a night out, is a red flag to lenders. Unless you have stellar credit, the odds are against you in getting the loan approved.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Go to your bank</strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">If you have a current and savings account with your bank, or have been banking with your bank for years, why not start there for your loan. They know you.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">By going to your bank where you have banked for years, and they can see your wages being paid in, and also what direct debits and standing orders you have, and also your account activity, can improve your chances on getting the loan approved.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>References</strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">If you feel your credit is not as strong as you think it should be in order to get a loan approved, you can look at some unconventional ways to show you are a good risk to a lender, and that is through references, and showing you pay other bills on time.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">You can request a reference from your landlord, stating you pay your rent on time and have been a model tenant.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">You can show that you pay your gas, electric, and other bills you have in a timely manner.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">And lastly, you could look into getting a guarantor for the loan; someone to guarantee the loan for you.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">By following some of these tips, for some people who may have bad credit, it will improve your chances of getting approval for a loan, and avoid the dreaded rejected stamp.</p>\n'},excerpt:{rendered:"<p>There’s nothing that makes you feel worse than applying for a much needed loan and having it rejected.

The Plantation Owners Forum of Nigeria had accused businessmen of setting up refineries in countries close to Nigeria in order to use them as channels through which rejected oil from other parts of the world especially Malaysia is exported to Nigeria.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">“It appears that there is a conspiracy by both the importers and smugglers of the commodity to kill local production while flooding the market with imported oil. Should government watch hopelessly and helplessly while this very important subsector of the agricultural sector is annihilated?”</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The agency observed that in the past few years, there had been an increase in the production of the commodity in the country with moribund oil palm plantations being revamped, smallholder planting established far beyond the traditional oil palm belt to include the fringe states such as Kogi, Kaduna and Nasarawa.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">It noted however that there was a controversy over Nigeria’s production figures, adding, “While Index Mundi puts Nigeria’s production at 970,000 tonnes annually (a figure that has stagnated for 11 years), available data from the Plantation Owners Forum of Nigeria put domestic and industrial demand for palm oil in the country at 2.8 million tonnes annually with production at 1.8 million tonnes.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">“This leaves a production shortfall of about one million metric tonnes – a deficit, which ordinarily should be balanced off by imports.”</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">According to Agro Nigeria, the lack of agreement on production data has led to rising concern among industry players that more quantities of the commodity than the actual shortfall were either imported or smuggled into the country through land borders, a factor that has made the country a dumping ground for crude palm oil from Asian countries, especially Malaysia and Indonesia.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">It advised the Federal Government to embark on a series of interventions to save the industry from an impending collapse.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">“Specific interventions geared towards protecting the industry from importers and smugglers must be initiated if Nigeria must sustain her position as part of world’s top producers. For instance, where the Central Bank’s Anchor Borrowers’ Programme does not cover oil palm because of its maturity period, government must seek alternative ways of incentivising plantation owners.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">“There must be increased security for oil palm plantations which have recently come under increased attacks from herdsmen. Hunters have in their search for game set bushes on fire, which sometimes gets out of control and they raze hectares of oil palm plantations as recently reported in a North-Central state (Plateau).</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">“Poor infrastructure has also been the bane in the quest to achieve growth in the sector. Government must approve and execute infrastructural projects such as roads to reduce transportation costs, which add to the huge production costs of palm oil.”</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Copyright PUNCH.<br />\n</strong>All rights reserved.

It is not a new or incremental debt, because it will not lead to an increase in the public debt stock.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">“The purpose is to rebalance the Federal Government’s debt portfolio by increasing the external component, while reducing the domestic component in line with Nigeria’s Debt Management Strategy, which has a target of 40:60 ratio for external to domestic debt from the current position of about 25:75, respectively.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">“The proceeds of the planned $2.5bn will be converted to naira and be used to redeem relatively more expensive domestic debts. This is expected to save about N64bn per annum in interest cost, which will help to reduce the debt service/revenue ratio and free up the fiscal space for other priorities of government.”</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">In December 2017, the government had redeemed matured Nigerian Treasury Bills with proceeds of the $500m Eurobonds issued in November.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The move, according to the DMO, saved the Federal Government about N17bn per annum in debt service costs.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">It added that the step also led to a significant drop in the bid rates at the auctions of both the NTBs and FGN Bonds in December 2017 and January 2018 from a range of 16 per cent to about 13.5 per cent.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">“This translates to savings for government on new borrowings and reduction of pressure on lending rates in the economy with positive impact on job creation and poverty reduction,” the DMO said.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The agency explained that the debt substitution would also help to lengthen the maturity profile of the nation’s debt portfolio and leave more borrowing space for the private sector to access credit to grow the real sector, including export, which would increase the foreign exchange earning capacity of the economy.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Copyright PUNCH.<br />\n</strong>All rights reserved.

That is private and public sectors working closely together. Wherever necessary, the public should invite the private; and wherever necessary, the private should work with the public.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">“We did that when I was in government. I invited a major importer of cement and asked him, why can’t we become producers and exporters? And from the answers he gave, I told my then Minister of Industry to further look into the answers and fine-tune them.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">“And this led to the formulation of the policy on cement. Twelve years after, cement is not only being produced here, it is being exported to other countries. That is the kind of synergy I am talking about. The symbiotic relationship between the public and private sectors must be strengthened.”</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">“Again, whatever we need to do, we must do it to make the civil servants ICT compliant. This is very important. I started that while I was in government but it was not sustained,” he added.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Obasanjo, who had earlier commended the Lawson-led executive for its visionary leadership in deploying ICT in collating the database of all the small and medium-scale enterprises in the country, said the association should select other areas in the economy and proffer solutions to the challenges there.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">He called on NACCIMA to empower the youth and women, because “if you empower a woman, you have empowered a whole family; and when a woman earns money, she uses that money to take care of her children unlike her male counterpart.”</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Copyright PUNCH.<br />\n</strong>All rights reserved.

The EU, through the National Quality Infrastructure Programme implemented by UNIDO, has supported the process since 2016.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">“This support has been in multiple ways, which include the establishment of a full chain management system, the conduit of excellence, a value chain diagnostic to address the concerns raised by the director-general, health and food safety; support to the inter-ministerial committee; and support to the visit of the Senate Health Committee to Europe in 2016.”</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Amato, who disclosed this at the Federal Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development, added, “Others include workshops for farmers/producers/processors on standard operating procedures for dried beans and support to prepare the export control plan.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">“Ultimately, it will be the DG of Health and Food Safety that will decide if the conditions are met to lift the ban once the integrated export control plan will be formally submitted for his attention. The support of the NQIP will continue until July of this year.”</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development, who doubles as the Co-Chairman of the UNIDO-NQIP Committee, Chief Audu Ogbeh, stated that the world was being driven by trade and Nigeria must get it right when it comes to the exportation of agricultural produce.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">“It is not only about export but the quality of produce that we export and what we eat. We poison ourselves a lot by what we eat. This assignment is far more serious than the idea of produce export, because we must ensure that what we eat and export is safe for our health and the health of other people,” he said.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Copyright PUNCH.<br />\n</strong>All rights reserved.

The Land Use Charge payable in Lagos State, which is being replicated across the country, is based on property valuation. The governor’s consent fees payable on alienation of interest in property across the country is based on property valuation. Capital Gains Tax payable on disposal of property is somehow influenced by property valuation. Rent payable on lease of real estate property is subject to withholding tax deduction.”</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">In addition to these, according to the group, the properties of its member companies were also subjected to valuation pursuant to the provisions of the Companies and Allied Matters Act Cap C20 Laws of the federation for the purposes of companies’ annual accounts leading to payment of tax on their profits.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">In the communiqué, the Director-General, MAN,  Segun Osidipe, stated that member companies of the association paid huge sums of money to state governments under the above heads of taxation, “which we believe the states are utilising efficiently for the benefit of all.”</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">He added, “Using the value of the property housing the offices of companies to generate figures that will be charged as Company Income Tax is wrong as some companies are tenants in their   buildings.”</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">According to the group, the exercise will have dire consequences on firms, households and government, noting, “The FIRS’ intention to value and assess the same property for tax purposes expressly negates the Federal Government’s objective of improving the ease of doing business recently initiated.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">“It is capable of discouraging new private investments and will place existing companies in precarious situation, which may lead to their closing down their businesses.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">“As companies close down, government’s tax revenue will be adversely affected. Already, the ratio of Nigeria’s tax-to-Gross Domestic Product is abysmally small at six per cent. This will further dip.”</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">According to the group, households will also be at the receiving end of high commodity prices and unemployment that will accompany company closures.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">It stated, “From the foregoing, we therefore see the FIRS’ initiatives as unlawful, impracticable and an economic misadventure, which will not benefit the economy, government, companies and households as the country will be the ultimate loser.”</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">While noting that the OPS appreciated the current financial position of the government and the need to increase Internally Generated Revenue, it however cautioned that this should not be at the detriment of tax-compliant member organisations and the fragile economy.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">“It is important that any measure to increase the IGR of government must be in line with provision of extant tax law and global best practices. The FIRS in this circumstance has no legal right to assess company’s property for tax purpose.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">“We would however advise the FIRS to device a legal framework that will bring the numerous non-tax paying organisations into the tax net rather than pursuing a non-justifiable measure that will end up crowding out existing tax-compliant organisations and thereby throwing the country into chaos.”</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The group emphasised the need for dialogue and frequent interaction which according to them will reduce the lag in information and communication in relation to businesses and act as a feedback mechanism.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">“We solicit that a mechanism be put in place to ensure the sustenance and effectiveness of a quarterly forum with the Organised Private Sector and request more collaboration in engaging member companies in public enlightenment of tax and related issues.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">“In the interest of our country, Nigeria, the leadership of the OPS is willing to engage with the FIRS further on this issue in the spirit of social dialogue, hoping for a progressive resolution in the interest of our nation,” it stated.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Copyright PUNCH.<br />\n</strong>All rights reserved.
