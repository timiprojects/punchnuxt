Briefly an MP from 1999, she wrote for several dailies including Hurriyet.</p>\n<p>Ahmet Altan, 67, is a novelist and journalist who has written for some of Turkey&#8217;s leading dailies including Hurriyet and Milliyet. He founded the now closed opposition daily Taraf.</p>\n<p>Mehmet Altan, 65, has written books on Turkish politics. Both were detained in early September although Ahmet Altan was released in mid-September before rapidly being re-arrested.</p>\n<p>In the same case, the court gave life sentences to former Zaman newspaper marketing manager Yakup Simsek, police academy instructor Sukru Tugrul Ozsengul and Zaman layout designer Fevzi Yazici.</p>\n<p>The Altan brothers and Ilicak are also accused of appearing together on a TV show on a pro-Gulen channel just before the coup bid and issuing a message that the attempted overthrow was in the offing.</p>\n<p>The International Press Institute (IPI) said it was &#8220;appalled&#8221; at the verdict, describing it as in &#8220;utter disregard for the rule of law&#8221;.</p>\n<p><strong>&#8211; &#8216;Decisions are binding&#8217; &#8211;</strong></p>\n<p>Mehmet Altan was in January ordered to be freed by the Constitutional Court but the ruling was not implemented by the criminal court in a move that outraged supporters.</p>\n<p>The failure to release Mehmet Altan and fellow writer Sahin Alpay &#8212; who is being tried in a separate case &#8212; raised new alarm over the rule of law in Turkey.</p>\n<p>The Ankara-based Constitutional Court had ruled that Mehmet Altan and Alpay should be freed on the grounds that their rights had been violated.</p>\n<p>But Istanbul criminal courts refused to implement the order, saying it had not been properly communicated in a move that raised fears of political interference.</p>\n<p>Jagland praised the Constitutional Court&#8217;s ruling and warned: &#8220;These decisions are binding. This is guaranteed by the Turkish Constitution.

of interventions that were previously only used to avoid risks or treat complications, such as oxytocin infusion to speed up labour or caesarean sections.</p>\n<p>Studies show that a substantial proportion of healthy pregnant women undergo at least one clinical intervention during labour and birth.</p>\n<p>“If labour is progressing normally, and the woman and her baby are in good condition, they do not need to receive additional interventions to accelerate labour,” Simelela added.</p>\n<p>Based on 56 evidence-based recommendations, the new guidelines include having a companion of choice during labour and childbirth.</p>\n<p>It also include ensuring respectful care and good communication between women and health providers and maintaining privacy and confidentiality.</p>\n<p>It further

that the duration of the active first stage of labour varies from one woman to another.</p>\n<p>The UN agency also noted that with more women giving birth in health facilities with skilled health professionals and timely referrals, they deserved better quality of care.</p>\n<p>Estimates show that about 830 women die from pregnancy- or childbirth-related complications around the world every day – the majority of which can be prevented with high-quality care.</p>\n<p>“Achieving the best possible physical, emotional, and psychological outcomes for the woman and her baby requires a model of care in which health systems empower all women to access care that focuses on the mother and child,” WHO underscored.

I am quite conscious that it is my responsibility as the IG, to put sufficient security architecture in place to manage the challenges and I can say with confidence that preventive and detective strategies have been put in place.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">“…ethnic strife, religious and other crises can be avoided and peaceful coexistence and genuine reconciliation attained when the citizens feel secure and have a sense of justice and fairness. For instance, the case of farmers/herders’ clashes is generating a lot of concern in Nigeria, especially in the recent clashes in Benue, Taraba, Adamawa states and other parts of the country.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">“It is true that the President (Muhammadu Buhari) has mandated me and other security agencies to take appropriate steps to ensure the arrest and prosecution of the offenders. This directive is being pursued with zeal but of utmost importance is that we must engage ourselves in serious conversation, avoid inflammatory comments or play politics with the issue. This is the only way the country can secure genuine reconciliation among herders and farmers so that they can once again live in peace, harmony, love and avoid unnecessary loss of lives.”</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">In his address, the Oba of Lagos, Rilwan Akiolu, said the current security challenges were envisaged about two decades ago, adding that the government was advised then to look into the country’s porous borders.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">A former Ogun State governor, Segun Osoba, said devolution of powers and state policing would go a long way in resolving the challenges facing the country.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">But a former governor of Kebbi State and member of the Senate, Adamu Aliero, has urged states in the North to establish cattle ranches to stop open grazing towards the southern part of the country.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Aliero said this in a statement issued in Abuja on Thursday, titled, ‘How to Stop the Farmers and Herdsmen’s Clashes Across Nigeria and Save Our Agriculture.’</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">He also charged states in the South to create ranches from which they could generate revenue.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Aliero said, “…To stop the increasing death toll across the country, I want to urge all states, particularly the 19 northern states, to urgently provide enabling laws to build ranches across the states, followed by a recall of all cattle currently grazing outside northern Nigeria.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">“The ranches can be rented and reasonable fees charged in the course of time. In the short-term, however, the ranches should be free initially and steadily rise to a reasonable rent or a form of grazing tax introduced. The governments can take a small percentage from the sale of cattle when this occurs, is another option that state governments can explore.”</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Also, the Federal Road Safety Commission has lamented obstructions of major roads by herdsmen and their cattle in major cities across the country.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">This, the FRSC noted, had been endangering the lives of Nigerians.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">An Assistant Corps Marshal of the FRSC, Nwaka Agnes, said this in an interview with journalists on the sidelines of the foundation laying ceremony of an office block of the FRSC Zonal Command in Ilorin, the Kwara State capital on Thursday.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Also, some traditional rulers in Ondo State  under the auspices of the 130 Crown Club on Thursday called on Governor Rotimi Akeredolu not to allow the controversial cattle colony to be established in the state.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">In a communique issued at the end of their meeting held at the palace of the Ogbolu of Ita-Ogbolu in Akure North Local Government,  Oba Idowu Faborode , the traditional rulers expressed worry over the frequent attacks of the herdsmen in different parts of the state in the recent time.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The communique was read on behalf of the traditional rulers by the monarch of Ipe-Akoko, Oba Francis Apata.

style="text-align: justify;">They stated this in their papers filed before the Federal High Court in Abuja in opposition to the suit marked, FHC/ABJ/CS/1142/2017.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The suit was instituted by the Incorporated Trustees of Advocacy for Societal Rights Advancement and Development Initiative led by its Executive Director, Adeolu Oyinlola.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">ASRADI said in the suit that the CBN and its governor refused to honour its Freedom of Information request contained in its letter of October 19, 2017.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">But, in their counter affidavit filed on February 13, 2018, the CBN and its governor urged the court to reject the applicant’s prayers and dismiss the suit.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">They equally urged the court to vacate an earlier ex parte order granting leave to the applicant to apply for “a prerogative order of mandamus” compelling them to provide the information requested.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">They admitted receiving the October 19, 2017 letter from ASRADI, but forwarded it to the President’s Chief of Staff, who they believed was the proper person to provide the information sought by the applicant.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The CBN and its governor accused the applicant of failing to inform the court that they wrote it, informing the group to resort to the President’s Chief of Staff for the information it sought.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">They stated, “Upon the receipt of the applicant’s application for information, the bank (CBN) transferred the same application to the office of the Chief of Staff to the President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">“The particular information sought by the applicant related to the overseas medical expenses incurred on the President of Nigeria, General Muhammadu Buhari and the  aircraft parking fees at the Stansted Airport in the UK.”</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The CBN and its governor added that having transferred the applicant’s request to the President’s Chief of Staff in line with the requirement of the Freedom of Information Act, the request should have been made to the President’s Chief of Staff.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The plaintiff’s letter had sought information on the amount they released for Buhari’s medical treatment in London and the amount they paid on behalf of the Nigerian government as parking fees for keeping the presidential aircraft and crew in the UK while the President’s treatment lasted.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">In the suit, with the CBN, its governor and the Attorney General of the Federation as respondents, ASRADI sought a declaration that the respondents’ refusal to provide it with information sought through its letter of October 19, 2017 “amounts to a wrongful denial of information and is a flagrant violation of the provisions of the Freedom of Information (FOI) Act 2011.”</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">It also sought an order compelling the respondents to furnish it with information sought in the letter of October 19, 2017, and a further order, mandating the CBN and its governor to pay the plaintiff N10m in damages “for the wilful refusal of the 1st and 2nd respondents to release information in respect of the applicant’s letter dated October 19, 2017.”</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">In a supporting affidavit, Oyinlola contended that it was within the responsibilities of the CBN and its governor to provide the requested information saying they “are responsible for all foreign currency transactions of the Nigerian government or transactions involving the Federal Government of Nigeria and foreign institutions concerning transfer of money outside the shores of Nigeria.”</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Oyinlola further stated that in the interest of the Nigerian public, the court should grant his group’s prayers to compel the respondents to declare the requested information because ASRADI was daily inundated with demands from the public to investigate the amount of taxpayers’ money spent on treating the President in London and keeping a presidential aircraft there for 103 days.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Justice John Tsoho has adjourned till April 17 for the hearing of the main suit along with any objection filed by any of the respondents.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Copyright PUNCH.</strong><strong><br />\n</strong><em>All rights

routes.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">“It also noted that the land use laws and regulations invest the states with power over land titles and use, while the Vice-President added that the Federal Government will not impose on state governments. The FG will only share templates on best practices for the conduct of livestock production and business.”</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The governor also said the Group General Manager of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation, Maikanti Baru, briefed the council on Premium Motor Spirit supply and the cost of under-recoveries arising from the difference between importation cost and the Petroleum Product Pricing Regulatory Agency cut off market price.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Baru reportedly told the council that the PMS open market price was continuously shaped by crude oil price volatility in the international market with the attendant cost under-recoveries due to differential between actual supply and distribution.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">He informed members that favourable market conditions encouraged private participation by independent marketers in Nigeria between May and September 2016.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Baru was said to have explained that there was currently a sudden decline in private participation in Nigeria due to decline in favourable market condition and also the sudden shock in consumption which was overstretched.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The Bauchi State governor said, “The GMD of NNPC submitted his report and the NEC has a committee that has been interfacing with all revenue generating agencies of the Federal Government under the chairmanship of the governor of Gombe State.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">“That committee has been given the responsibility of interfacing with the NNPC with a view to determining the correct price for PMS considering the price of the product in especially countries that are bordering Nigeria because that is one reason that encourages smuggling of the products to these areas.”</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">On how some Federal Government’s revenue generating agencies had been engaging in under-remittance of revenue, the Lagos State Deputy Governor, Oluranti Adebule, told State House correspondents that the council received the final report on the forensic audit of the agencies as regards the revenue accrued into the Federation Account, Excess Crude Account and Consolidated Revenue Fund.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">She said the report which was prepared by the audit firm, KPMG, concerned 18 agencies including the NNPC Federal Inland Revenue Service, Nigeria Customs Services, Nigerian Maritime Administration and Safety Agency, Nigerian Ports Authority, Nigerian Communication Commission, Central Bank of Nigeria, Department of Petroleum Resources and the Nigerian Petroleum Development Company Limited, among others.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The report, she explained, covered the period between January 2010 and June 2015.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The Lagos deputy governor said, “The report observed several cases of under-remittance and  a few over-remittance.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">“There were also late remittances into the various accounts.  It therefore recommended that NEC should decide on repayment plans for all concerned, as well as stepping up oversight function on the relevant agencies to ensure remittance as and when due.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">“It also recommended the proper and regular auditing of the amount of the RGAs and those of the FG. It also said there was the need for annual review of the agencies.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">“Council received the report and resolved that the Ad-hoc NEC committee on the matter be expanded to include a lawyer and an accountant.  The committee would study the KPMG report and report back to council at its next sitting for possible adoption.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">“The Federal Government officials, including the CBN Governor, the Ministers of Finance, Budget and National Planning and Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, would join the expanded committee to also take a look at the report.”</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The Special Adviser to the President on Special Investment Programme, Maryam Uwais, gave an update on the programme, which she said had recorded total direct beneficiaries of 7,812,201 and secondary beneficiaries of 1,500,000, mainly farmers and cooks.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Uwais put the total actual spending on the programme in 2016 and 2017 at 15.58 </em><em>per cent of the budgets.</em></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">She listed some of the challenges facing the programme to include corrupt practices in states, such as short-changing, racketeering and harassment of beneficiaries, exploitation of the vulnerable due to poor levels of literacy, as well as monitoring and communication problems resulting from insufficient awareness/publicity.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">To surmount the problems, the presidential aide said the government was collaborating with various organisations within and outside the government in the areas of monitoring and security.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">In a statement later made available to journalists, the Accountant-General of the Federation, Ahmed Idris, was said to have put the balance in the ECA as of February 14, 2018,  at $2,317,252,449.57; Stabilisation Fund Account, N11,290,664,060.06; and the Natural Resources Development Fund at N123,624,644,411.24.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">On the budget support loan facility, Idris said 23 states had accessed  the facility out of which 11 states received in January 2018, adding that the remaining 12 states would soon get theirs.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Out of the remaining 13, he said five states had complied with the Fiscal Sustainability Plan and would be considered.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">“The eight outstanding states are under consideration under the 22-point requirement of the Fiscal Sustainability Plan. A total of N16.1bn has been disbursed as of January 2018,” he added.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">”<strong>Copyright PUNCH.</strong><strong><br />\n</strong><em>All rights reserved.

I congratulate you for your support for President Muhammadu Buhari to run in 2019.”</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The SGF, who was represented by the Senior Special Assistant to the President on Political Matters, Gideon Sammani, said Buhari was widely known for his stance against corruption and indiscipline, noting that many people feared him because of his uncompromising position on graft.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Mustapha argued that it was the corrupt individuals that were against the President because they were apprehensive that they might be brought to book.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">He added, “We all know that Buhari is transparent, honest. He has come with the change philosophy. He has lived for this long to bring change to this nation. Since his military days, he stood to fight corruption and indiscipline.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">“Many people fear him because he does not compromise, and corrupt people are afraid that they will be brought to book.

Youths should make a difference. I want youths to make a success of their participation in politics. And the INEC should provide a fertile ground for democracy to thrive.

Court in Wawa Cantonment, Kainji, Niger State, on Thursday sentenced Babagana Ali to 25 years imprisonment for participating in Boko Haram’s attacks in different communities in Borno State in 2015.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The court, although presided over by another judge, also sentenced one Sunday Abana of the Askira Uba Local Government Area of Borno State to 40 years imprisonment for participating in the attacks of the sect in 2013.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Abana, who pleaded guilty to the 10 counts preferred against him, confessed that he was trained in weapon handling by Boko Haram in “the forest.”</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">He also confessed that he “actively participated” in the sect’s attacks in eight named villages where many lives were lost.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Twenty-seven years old Ali, who pleaded guilty to the three counts of terrorism preferred against him on Thursday, was said to have worked as a security guard in Ikoyi, Lagos, after he escaped from a Boko Haram camp in Borno State in 2013.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">He spent a period in Lagos but was arrested by the Civilian Joint Task Force in Maiduguri in 2015 after he decided to return to Borno State as peace was gradually restored in the state.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Ali, who was born and brought up in Banki town, Bama Local Government Area of Borno State, was said to have been initiated into the sect by his father, Abubakar Baluye.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The prosecution said he escaped from the Boko Haram camp after the sect members killed his father as a punishment for revealing secret information of the group.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">“The defendant escaped to Lagos and stayed within Ikoyi where he was selling recharge cards and working as a security guard,” the prosecuting counsel said.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Ali confessed that while being an active member of the sect, he handled different types of rifles which he did not know their names as he participated in many attacks of the sect at Gamboru, Nagala, Baga, Dikwa, Banki and Njimtilo.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">He confessed killing many people whose number he could not remember during the attacks.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">During his trial on Wednesday, the prosecution accused him of killing his father, an allegation which he denied.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Ali explained that he was only ordered by the Boko Haram council in his camp to call his father whom they later found guilty of an offence punishable by death.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">He said he was asked to leave after he arrived at the said council with his father who was later killed after he had departed the place.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The prosecution urged the court to pass the maximum death sentence which the Terrorism Prevention Act prescribes for such offences.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The defence however urged court to temper justice with mercy.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">In his judgment, the judge noted that the defendant’s claim that he abandoned the sect after his father was killed and escaped to Lagos was believable.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The court also noted that it would be merciful to him for not wasting the time of the court by pleading guilty to the charges.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">It also noted that from the evidence before the court that the convict had been exposed by his father to the teachings of Boko Haram sect from infancy, the period in which it would not have been possible for him to differentiate between right and wrong.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The judge thereby sentenced him to 15 years for professing to be a member of Boko Haram, 25 years for participating in the attacks of the sect and seven years for failing to disclose information about the sect to security authority.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">All the sentences are to run concurrently.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Abana, who was sentenced to 40 years on eight out of the 10 counts preferred against him, had pleaded guilty to all the charges.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">He was sentenced to 20 years for professing to be a member of Boko Haram and to 30 years for receiving training in weapon handling by Boko Haram.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">All the sentences are to run concurrently.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The 40 years sentences were for his “active” participation in the sect’s attack in Jabwan, Gatamanrwa, Jejere, Makalama, Yumirmizha, Kautikari, Mbalala and Binwi villages.</p>\n<p style="text-align:

APC faction ‘queries’ el-Rufai, ‘suspends’ commissioner"},content:{rendered:'<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Godwin Isenyo, Kaduna</strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Fresh crisis erupted in the All Progressives Congress in Kaduna State as the party on Thursday issued a query and warning letter to Governor Nasir el-Rufai over what the party described as his anti-party and anti-human activities in the state.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Though the query and warning letter emanated from a  faction of the party, known as ‘The Restoration APC’ in the state, its Acting Chairman, Danladi Wada, claimed he is the authentic chairman duly recognised by the national headquarters of the APC in Abuja.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Also, the APC slammed 18 months suspension on the Political Adviser to the Governor, Mallam Uba Sani and the state Commissioner for Finance, Alhaji Audu Kwaru, as well as the Acting State Secretary of the party, Alhaji Yahaya  Baba-Pate.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">In the letter signed by Wada, a copy of which was made available to newsmen in Kaduna during a press conference, the faction stated that the suspension and query of the governor was with immediate effect.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Wada added that el-Rufai was expected to answer the query within 48 hours, noting that failure to do so would attract further disciplinary actions.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The letter was copied to the National Chairman of the APC, Vice-Chairman, North-West Zone of the party, INEC Headquarters, Abuja, INEC Kaduna, the State Independent Electoral Commission, all the APC Local Government Chairmen, Kaduna State Command’s Police Commissioner, DSS, Kaduna Command and all media houses in Kaduna State.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The chairman also announced the relocation of the party secretariat to 11B Sambo Road in Kaduna metropolis.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">He said the decision to relocate the party office was approved by the majority members of the State Executive Committee because the former office was infested with thugs.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Reacting to the query, El-Rufai said, “We are sending political traders into retirement.”</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">He added that he would not be swayed by the drowning antics of some political traders on the state.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">El-Rufai in a statement by his Senior Special Assistant on Media and Publicity, Mr. Samuel Aruwan,   also warned that “rascally actions being undertaken by these traders in the hope of getting a lifeline from reconciliation moves would  not be rewarded.”</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The governor said, “The APC Government of Kaduna State has boldly lived up to its manifesto, commitments and principles to the people. In this work, it continues to enjoy the firm support of the APC State Executive which is united, and committed to the hard work of bringing sustainable change.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">“The government appreciates the support it has received from the party in executing policies that stand up for the right of the ordinary people to equal opportunity. That support was vividly demonstrated as the government took drastic action to ensure that only qualified teachers teach the children of the poor.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">“Governor Nasir el-Rufai is proud of his record in achieving unprecedented levels of capital spending in the state, direct job creation, doubling school enrolment and doubling internally generated revenue.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">“The governor has no doubt that the people of Kaduna State have seen who is committed to building schools, roads and hospitals, and bringing investors and will make the right choice in their own interest. The political traders are also aware that the people know who is standing up for them.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">“The government had been made aware of the boastful and pompous claims of Senator Suleiman Othman Hunkuyi, that he will change the leadership of Kaduna State in 2019 by installing himself as governor.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">“The desperate senator is seeking a lifeline, in the vain belief that ratcheting up rascally actions will bring him attention and relief from the mooted national reconciliation efforts. Senator Hunkuyi has further illegally created a faction, headquartered in his house, as a bargaining chip.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">“This senator has failed to understand that you cannot create party executives at your whim. It is the party’s prerogative to consider appropriate responses to this breach of discipline. But as a government, we view these actions as the needless drama of political traders.”</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Since the party came into power in May, 2015, it has been enmeshed in crisis, leading to the formation of three factions of the APC in the state.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">They include, the ‘Restoration APC’ led by Alhaji Tijjani Ramallan and Senator Suleiman Hunkuyi; the ‘APC Akida’ led by Senator Shehu Sani and the Chief of Staff to the Senate President, Dr. Hakeem Baba-Ahmed.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Wada, who belonged to the ‘Restoration APC,’ was the Deputy Chairman of the party in the state before the 2015 general elections.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">He (Wada) claimed the National Secretariat of the party recognised him as the authentic chairman of the party in the state.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Meanwhile, in a statement, the senator representing the Kaduna North Senatorial District, Hunkuyi confirmed that the National Headquarters of the APC duly recognised Wada as the acting chairman of the APC in the state.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">In view of the development, Hunkuyi, who is the Chairman Senate Committee on National Identity Card, said as a loyal member of the party, he would align with the national leaders of the party that recognised Wada as the acting chairman of the party in the state.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>He urged all members of the party in the state to comply with the decision of the national headquarters of the party.</em></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Copyright PUNCH.</strong><strong><br />\n</strong><em>All rights reserved.

Nonetheless, since something is never built on nothing, there must be an end to a process. So, first and foremost, there is an overall boss, a consenting authority who is looked up to by all those on the ladder of appointment, be it the minister or head of the agency.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Consequently, if that be the case, with the present state of affairs, a minister may not be able to discipline heads of agencies he oversees. The best he/she can do is to report any malfeasance involving the head of the agency concerned to the President. Unless empowered by the President, a minister cannot unilaterally discipline heads of agencies under him.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">With the benefit of hindsight, as the former Secretary to the Osun State Government, I never took any of such actions, if at all, without carrying my boss along.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">This will go a long way in reducing friction within the system. Unregulated power could as well be misused by a minister, especially if he/she does not like the face and/or if the head of such agency is not dancing to the minister’s tune.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">So, to me, this issue is somewhat open ended and can be viewed from different perspectives.</p>\n<ul style="text-align: justify;">\n<li><em>Mr. Louis Alozie (Principal Partner, Equity Chambers, Owerri,  Imo State)</em></li>\n</ul>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">When a public servant is engaged by the Federal Civil Service Commission, for instance, it is the commission that has the power to employ, discipline, suspend, dismiss or terminate the appointment of the employee.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">In fact, no minister can usurp these functions. His own is to report to the board.  The management of the agency concerned should have a disciplinary board or panel charged with such a responsibility at every level. What the minister can do is, if he has a case against any junior or senior worker in the establishment concerned, he should send the person to that panel. The panel can after investigations make recommendations to the appropriate body, in this case the Civil Service Commission.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">If you look at the case of the former Chairman of the Presidential Pension Task Team, Abdulrasheed Maina, and  the controversy it generated, it boiled down to the Office of the Head of Service of the Federation, the Federal Civil Service Commission, which is the appropriate body that should have reinstated him.  That is the way it is done. It boils down to due process.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">What I am saying is that whatsoever that has to be done, due process as spelt out in the Civil Service Rules and Regulations should be followed. That is why you have many people that were wrongfully dismissed seeking remedy in court and the court ordering their reinstatement. This happens when the court is convinced that proper procedure was not followed. Ministers are political appointees; I am saying they do not have powers to discipline heads of agencies they supervise.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Assuming you have a worker who has a contrary political opinion; that is, someone not in the minister’s political camp, what do you think will happen to that person? The minister can handle the discipline of the junior staff. I would not say, for instance, if his personal driver misbehaves, he cannot send him away. He can write to the permanent secretary to post him out. If the person has stolen for instance, of course, it is a crime. The matter should be reported to the police and investigations have to take place; it is only the court that can pronounce someone guilty.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Most of the time, we are in a hurry to achieve these objectives and when they jump the process or circumvent it, it is usually voided by the court.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The minister has the power for junior workers, but that power is limited by civil service rules and regulations. It is the contract between the employer and the employees.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">He can handle the case of a junior worker, but there is one thing in law that we all know, if someone is working with the government, there is a law that establishes that office. It gives powers to certain persons to engage this person based on certain terms and conditions.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">That contract becomes one with statutory flavour. It is not a master and servant relationship. If it is a master and servant relationship, like in the case of private sector employments, you can fire somebody even if he does nothing.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">You do not need to give a reason. You can fire him because you do not like him or maybe, somebody who has offended you personally one way or the other.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">But if the person has employment with statutory flavour, like in the civil service, the process of asking him to go is very clear. If you do not follow it by civil service rules and regulations, it cannot work.</p>\n<ul style="text-align: justify;">\n<li><em> Habeeb Whyte (Ogun State-based legal practitioner) </em></li>\n</ul>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">It is going to be improper if ministers cannot punish the heads of the agencies they supervise, especially when such an officer is found wanting in the discharge of his or her duties.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Ministers are political appointees that oversee the day-to-day running of affairs of the agencies they supervise. Ordinarily, the ministers are the heads of the agencies, save for laws that state otherwise.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The law is simple and clear on administrative duties and functions. The law is to the effect that where an institution has been created, there should be offices with specific powers.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The same laws that provide for the offices would attach powers to them. The powers may include those of appointments, procedures for removal of erring officers and most importantly, the control of activities of such agencies.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">However, a proper digestion of laws that empower most of our agencies, especially at the federal level, do not give ministers the sole power to discipline heads of the agencies they supervise.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The power is vested in the board of such agencies which the minister, as a political appointee, heads but not as a direct administrative head.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">If the minister single-handedly takes a disciplinary action against the head of the agency he supervises, he has acted outside his powers. But if he does so with the approval of the board of such an agency, he has acted accordingly.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">An exception that might come as a matter of necessity is if he has the authority of the President, his actions on the issue of discipline of the head of any agency would be deemed to be proper.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The minister ordinarily should have powers to discipline the heads of the agency he/she supervises as the overall head.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The ministers should have powers to even recommend appropriate punishments for officers that have erred in the discharge of their duties.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">As the overall head, he would be the one that would be accountable for the good, the bad and ugly activities of such agency.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The law has not empowered them directly but I find it improper. Our laws should be amended to reflect reality. The amendments could come with words of caution and instances of exceptions, to avoid abuse of power.</p>\n<ul style="text-align: justify;">\n<li><em>Dr. Godwin Ekong (Uyo-based public affairs analyst)</em></li>\n</ul>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Yes, the ministers should have the power to discipline the heads of the agencies they supervise. The ministers, as the political/administrative heads of these agencies, are accountable for the actions and inactions of the agencies and not the heads of the agencies. If the head of any agency they supervise do not live up to expectations, the minister has the power to question their activities. He has a duty to prevent any infraction that can hamper the smooth running of the agency concerned.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">These heads of agencies, who are career civil servants that know the activities of their agencies more than the ministers, are not vested with ultimate powers to run these agencies.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">They are, therefore, accountable to political heads who are the ministers, who in turn are accountable to the President. The ministers also have the right to discipline these career civil servants for acts of insubordination and this may lead to their dismissal depending on the gravity of the offence.</p>\n<ul style="text-align: justify;">\n<li><em>Auwal Musa (Executive Director, Civil Society Legislative and Advocacy Centre)</em></li>\n</ul>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">It is not a one way thing.

Yakubu Gowon; Senate President, Bukola Saraki, represented by Senator Monsura Sunmonu; Governor of Kebbi State, Atiku Bagudu; a former Speaker of the House of Representatives, Ghali Umar Na’Abba, the Metropolitan Catholic Archbishop of Abuja, John Cardinal Onaiyekan, and others.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Osinbajo said the judicial system was also affected by the slow pace of trials and “the manipulation of the systems by those who can afford superior legal representation.”</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">He added, “So, in ensuring security, problems of weak policing are some of the issues we experience. Also, the perception of the people on the efficiency and fairness of the justice system is affected by the slow pace of trials and the manipulation of the systems by those who can afford superior legal representation.”</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"> “So, you find that we have an anti- corruption war but questions remain as to how many people have been convicted. But the system can easily be manipulated because you put people on trial, but the trials can go on forever; we have a system that enables people to employ dilatory tactics. We need to strengthen the systems that people can rely and trust,” he emphasised.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The VP said the solution to the issues he enumerated was a merit-driven bureaucracy, a strong law and order architecture, the rule of law, and an adjudicatory system that would be well resourced and immune to manipulation.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"> He said African elite were making democracy difficult to practise on the continent by whittling down its practice.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">“The elite, it appears, prefer the status quo which sets the lowest possible bar for political advancement that is identity politics; where do you come from? Or to which religion do you belong? And it is through that paradigm that most issues are analysed.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">“So, the real issues that concern our people are often diminished – good governance, jobs for a growing population of young people, poverty alleviation, peace and security, etc. Those are never properly analysed, or even allowed to take their prominence in public debates especially in debates leading to elections,” Osinbajo said.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The VP  said there is no question that democracy and democratisation are challenged everywhere, even in the oldest democracies, adding that democracy is still work in progress.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The Ghanaian President, in his lecture, described the multi-party system of governance as best way to deepen  democracy in Africa.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Using his country as a case study, he said having tried everything else, Ghanaians finally reached a consensus that a multi-party system of governance was the best way to go.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">He said the Ghanaian Fourth Republic had lasted for 25 years under a multi-party constitution, noting that his country’s political landscape with three peaceful changes of government from a ruling party to the opposition party taking place during the Fourth Republic.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Akufo-Addo said, “I hesitate to preach to anyone on this particular subject; I would only say that we in Ghana, having tried everything else, have finally reached a consensus that the multi-party system of governance works best for us.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">“Our fourth republic has lasted for 25 years under a multi-party constitution. Indeed, we celebrated its silver jubilee on the 7th of January. We are stable and there have been three peaceful changes of government from a ruling party to an opposition party during the Fourth Republic.”</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">“I must also encourage the African Union member countries to demonstrate a commitment to strengthening and protecting the institutions and cultures of democratic governance; respecting human rights, religious freedom, the empowerment of women, and the rights of the individual and minorities, building strong market economies and facilitating the free movements of people, knowledge, goods and services across member states,” he added.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Copyright PUNCH.</strong><strong><br />\n</strong><em>All rights reserved.

It wants new elections, rather than the ANC deciding on the identity of the new president.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">It is often said that Ramaphosa has had his eye on the position of president since the ANC came to power in 1994.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Meanwhile, President Muhammadu Buhari on Thursday  congratulated Ramaphosa on his election as the President of the Republic of South Africa.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">In a statement by his Senior Special Assistant on Media and Publicity, Garba Shehu, the President also felicitated with the ANC and the government and people of South Africa, on the peaceful transfer of power that resulted in Ramaphosa’s election.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The statement read in part, “The Nigerian leader salutes the leadership and statesmanship of former President Jacob Zuma, and wishes him the best in his future endeavours.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">“President Buhari looks forward to working with the new President of South Africa to enhance cooperation of the Governments of Africa’s two leading economies.”</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">In a related development, the Ethiopian Prime Minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, has resigned unexpectedly, saying he hoped to end years of unrest and political upheaval.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">In a televised address, he said his resignation was “vital in the bid to carry out reforms that would lead to sustainable peace and democracy”.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Desalegn, who has led the country since 2012, also stepped down as the chairman of the ruling coalition.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">“Unrest and a political crisis have led to the loss of lives and displacement of many,” Desalegn said.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">“I see my resignation as vital in the bid to carry out reforms that would lead to sustainable peace and democracy.”</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">.”<strong>Copyright PUNCH.</strong><strong><br />\n</strong><em>All rights reserved.

Buhari on Thursday promised to take Nigeria to the next level despite the nation’s challenges.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Buhari made the promise in his remark at the induction of the Nigerian Air Force’s Unmanned Aerial Vehicle, Tsaigumi, in Kaduna.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">A copy of his speech was made available to journalists by the Presidency’s media office.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The President said his administration was determined to overcome all the challenges militating against the country’s security and development.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">He appealed to Nigerians to support his administration to achieve its objectives.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Buhari said, “Let me again reiterate our commitment and firm resolve to take this nation to the next level.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">“We remain determined to overcome all challenges to our security and development as a nation.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">“I enjoin all well-meaning Nigerians to join hands with us to make our collective dreams of greatness a reality.”</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The President said his government was committed to delivering the much-needed change that would make the difference in the nation.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">“The Government remains determined despite numerous challenges to bring about the much-needed change that will lift our beloved nation to its rightful place as a major economic and political force on the world stage,” he added.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Buhari disclosed that part of government’s drive to achieve the goal is to enable enterprise and improve the quality of life by improving national infrastructure.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">He reiterated his New Year’s Day broadcast to the nation that his administration had designed projects that would overhaul national infrastructure and overcome the deficit in the area.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">“The role of the military as an enabler of national development cannot be overemphasised, as efforts would be futile if national security is not first guaranteed.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">“In this regard, let me once more commend the gallant men and women of the Nigerian Armed Forces and other security agencies for their tireless efforts towards defeating Boko Haram and all other threats to our nation’s security, thus ensuring that the government can proceed with its developmental activity without hindrance,” he added.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Buhari commended the NAF for the innovation, saying the significance of the accomplishment could not be overestimated.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">He noted that the world was resorting to the use of unmanned vehicles in military operations because while the standard air weapons such as missiles, fighters and bombers work against well-defined targets like conventional enemy forces or installations, they are not as useful in today’s complex wars that are fought against adversaries who are often hidden amongst innocent populations or in locations similarly sensitive or difficult to strike by normal conventional means.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">He said the employment of unmanned vehicles for intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance and strike operations significantly increased the chance of success while minimising unwanted collateral damage.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The President said it was most gratifying that the Nigerian Air Force had gone a step further by developing unmanned vehicles with indigenous technology.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The accomplishment, which he described as outstanding, according to him, held promise of both military and economic benefit to the nation.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">“From the military perspective, the added capacity for intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance provided by the Tsaigumi will boost the ongoing and future security operations.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">“As this project moves into the next stage, which is mass production, it would create employment and possibly generate revenue as Nigeria’s first military export product.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">He added, “The attainment of this technological feat is an indication that there is indeed potential to similarly apply the same innovative mindset to addressing other areas of indigenous technological need.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">“While I commend the Nigerian Air Force for this accomplishment, I enjoin you not to rest on this achievement but to strive harder in your research and development efforts for greater innovation.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">“Be assured of this administration’s support towards the attainment of greater technological milestones for our nation.”.</p>\n<p
