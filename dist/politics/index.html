APC faction ‘queries’ el-Rufai, ‘suspends’ commissioner"},content:{rendered:'<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Godwin Isenyo, Kaduna</strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Fresh crisis erupted in the All Progressives Congress in Kaduna State as the party on Thursday issued a query and warning letter to Governor Nasir el-Rufai over what the party described as his anti-party and anti-human activities in the state.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Though the query and warning letter emanated from a  faction of the party, known as ‘The Restoration APC’ in the state, its Acting Chairman, Danladi Wada, claimed he is the authentic chairman duly recognised by the national headquarters of the APC in Abuja.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Also, the APC slammed 18 months suspension on the Political Adviser to the Governor, Mallam Uba Sani and the state Commissioner for Finance, Alhaji Audu Kwaru, as well as the Acting State Secretary of the party, Alhaji Yahaya  Baba-Pate.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">In the letter signed by Wada, a copy of which was made available to newsmen in Kaduna during a press conference, the faction stated that the suspension and query of the governor was with immediate effect.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Wada added that el-Rufai was expected to answer the query within 48 hours, noting that failure to do so would attract further disciplinary actions.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The letter was copied to the National Chairman of the APC, Vice-Chairman, North-West Zone of the party, INEC Headquarters, Abuja, INEC Kaduna, the State Independent Electoral Commission, all the APC Local Government Chairmen, Kaduna State Command’s Police Commissioner, DSS, Kaduna Command and all media houses in Kaduna State.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The chairman also announced the relocation of the party secretariat to 11B Sambo Road in Kaduna metropolis.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">He said the decision to relocate the party office was approved by the majority members of the State Executive Committee because the former office was infested with thugs.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Reacting to the query, El-Rufai said, “We are sending political traders into retirement.”</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">He added that he would not be swayed by the drowning antics of some political traders on the state.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">El-Rufai in a statement by his Senior Special Assistant on Media and Publicity, Mr. Samuel Aruwan,   also warned that “rascally actions being undertaken by these traders in the hope of getting a lifeline from reconciliation moves would  not be rewarded.”</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The governor said, “The APC Government of Kaduna State has boldly lived up to its manifesto, commitments and principles to the people. In this work, it continues to enjoy the firm support of the APC State Executive which is united, and committed to the hard work of bringing sustainable change.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">“The government appreciates the support it has received from the party in executing policies that stand up for the right of the ordinary people to equal opportunity. That support was vividly demonstrated as the government took drastic action to ensure that only qualified teachers teach the children of the poor.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">“Governor Nasir el-Rufai is proud of his record in achieving unprecedented levels of capital spending in the state, direct job creation, doubling school enrolment and doubling internally generated revenue.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">“The governor has no doubt that the people of Kaduna State have seen who is committed to building schools, roads and hospitals, and bringing investors and will make the right choice in their own interest. The political traders are also aware that the people know who is standing up for them.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">“The government had been made aware of the boastful and pompous claims of Senator Suleiman Othman Hunkuyi, that he will change the leadership of Kaduna State in 2019 by installing himself as governor.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">“The desperate senator is seeking a lifeline, in the vain belief that ratcheting up rascally actions will bring him attention and relief from the mooted national reconciliation efforts. Senator Hunkuyi has further illegally created a faction, headquartered in his house, as a bargaining chip.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">“This senator has failed to understand that you cannot create party executives at your whim. It is the party’s prerogative to consider appropriate responses to this breach of discipline.

Consequently, it is unthinkable to believe that anyone of the Senator’s standing would make such sweeping remarks. To put it plainly, only a mad man would say that Nigerians of Hausa/Fulani extraction would never rule Nigeria again in a democratic dispensation.”</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">It said the report was an attempt to damage Jang’s reputation, especially by linking the report to an alleged mobilisation by Christian leaders in the country towards the 2019 elections.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">“Instructively, it is worthy of note to opine that the Senator is on record to have been engaged in crucial advocacy calling on all Nigerians of different tribes, religions, cultures, and traditions to register for the sole purpose of exercising their franchise. Does that sound like calling on only Christians to register?</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">“Ordinarily, we would not have wasted our time responding to <em>Zuma Times,</em> considering the very obvious fact that they did not at any point in the publication substantiate their claims. There is also no gain in suing them for libel, especially at this momentous occasion when Nigerians are living under the most crushing conditions that might have motivated the publishers to sell their conscience for a plate of porridge in the hope that their paymasters would gain an imaginary political edge against the distinguished Senator Dr Jonah David Jang.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">“As it stands today, the Senator has been right about all the evils that bedevil our country whether they are mindless killings by suspected Fulani herdsmen in the Middle-Belt, biased corruption fights, or the reality of broken promises made by any means necessary for the sole purpose of confiscating power in 2015.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">“Senator Jonah Jang remains a giant among his equals, a beacon of hope to his people, and a committed person to the suffering of the minorities in the north who are persecuted for their beliefs, convictions, and persuasions. He can never be deterred by a publication of no consequence sponsored by those who have been rejected by a vast majority of Nigerians.”</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Copyright PUNCH.</strong><strong><br />\n</strong><em>All rights reserved.

It is very simple. You either adopt the report or you reject the report. So, I am going to make it simple and put the question,” Saraki said.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">After the vote, the Senate President ruled that “the ayes have it,” a development that generated uproar in the chamber.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Raising a point of order, Senator Ovie Omo-Agege called for a division, citing Order 73 of the Senate Standing Rules.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Responding, Saraki said, “As I keep on emphasising, institutions are what are important. As senators, we will finish our terms and go, but we must continue to strengthen institutions. We must always follow the procedures that we have all laid down.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">“For conference reports, this has been the procedure and as such, with all due respect, I have to rule you out of order.”</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Dissatisfied, Senator Kabiru Gaya raised another point of order, citing Order 87(C), which states that the conference committee can deliberate on issues between the Senate and House of Representatives but cannot make insertions on any matter not committed to it by either of the chambers.</p>\n<p><strong>READ ALSO:</strong> <a href="http://punchng.com/inec-releases-timetable-for-2019-elections/"><span style="color: #0000ff;">INEC releases timetable for 2019 elections</span></a></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">He said, “This report on the sequence of elections was never discussed here in the Senate. Why are we bringing it up here?”</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Also ruling Gaya out of order, Saraki said, “You are a ranking senator and I have all the utmost respect for you. I know that politics is local; and I appreciate that. But as much as it is local, we also have to maintain the integrity of this institution. I have heard you and I am sure that your constituency too have heard you; but I have to rule you out of order.”</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Still not satisfied, Senator Abdullahi Adamu, who is the Chairman of the Northern Senators’ Forum, raised another point of order, citing Section 76 of the Constitution and pointing out that only INEC was empowered to determine the date of elections.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Ruling Adamu out of order, Saraki said, “Thank you for the point you raised. As you know, we have ruled on this. And as you also know, there are many bills that we have passed and if there are issues, there are mechanisms within the system through which issues have been raised. With all due respect, I will say it is noted.”</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">At that point, several members began to scream, “Point of order!”</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Saraki, again, insisted that the lawmakers must be guided by the rules, especially Order 53(6). He urged members to allow consideration of the next item on the order paper.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Shortly after, 10 APC members stormed out of the chamber and moved to the Media Centre of the Senate Press Corps.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The senators, who claimed that 59 of them were against the amendment, were Abdullahi Adamu (Nasarawa-West), Abu Ibrahim (Katsina-North), Abdullahi Gumel (Jigawa-North), Ali Wakili (Bauchi-South), Binta Masi Garba (Adamawa-North), Ovie Omo-Agege (Delta-Central), Umar Kurfi (Katsina-Central), Andrew Uchendu (Rivers-East), Benjamin Uwajumogu (Imo-North), and Abdullahi Yahaya (Kebbi-North).</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The senators took turns to criticise the adoption of the report without a debate.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">They also alleged that the amendment was targeted at the Office of the President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria currently being occupied by Muhammadu Buhari.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The protesters cited irregularities in the signatories to the report.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Adamu said, “We feel very strongly that the process by which the so-called conference committee report was laid and considered was rushed.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">“We are against what happened. Incidentally, if you take note of the report that was laid – the report that was circulated – the chairman and the co-chairman did not sign it. We don’t know why they did not sign the report.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">“Normally, if we are going through due process, we need to know why they didn’t sign it, or do we have different reports submitted over the same bill from the same committee?”</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Alleging that the report was biased, Adamu stated that the bill needed better attention while its passage must be fair.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">He said, “Why do you want to do a law to address just one particular problem. This is a very partisan report; you could see it from the body language, the utterances and the gesturing that it is a pre-determined thing by a political party that is threatened by the APC government.”</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Also, Omo-Agege said, “Thirty six people in the House of Representatives cannot determine the faith and the destiny of 360 people in the House, which is now carried over to a Senate of 109. If a conference committee is set up to reconcile the differences, the least we are owed is for this amendment to Section 25 (of the Electoral Act) to be deliberated upon.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">“We did not even dissolve into the committee of the whole. We were not even given the opportunity to consider this.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">“Today, we have 59 senators who are opposed to the inclusion of this Section 25 in the Electoral Act. If that division (which he called for) was allowed 59 senators would have voted to delete that purported amendment to Section 25 of the Electoral Act.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">“You don’t make a law targeted at one person. The perception out there is that this Section 25 was included to target Mr. President,” he stated.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The Senate however insisted on the adoption of the report, stating that it had passed due process.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Chairman of the Senate Committee on Media and Public Affairs, Senator Aliyu Sabi-Abdullahi, who jointly addressed journalists with Nazif, dismissed the allegations by the aggrieved senators.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Nazif said, “Let me make it very clear that I have signed the concurrent committee report. I don’t know where that (allegation) came from, but I signed it. This is it, signed by me (displaying the report). And if you go to the clerk, it is also signed by me.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">“I am not aware if the sequence of election is being targeted at anybody. What I know is that as the Chairman of the Committee on INEC at the Senate, I chaired the concurrent committee of both the House and the Senate.</p>\n<p><strong>YOU MAY ALSO LIKE:</strong> <a href="http://punchng.com/10-corruption-cases-that-can-fetch-fg-74-5bn-n2-5trn/"><span style="color: #0000ff;">‘10 corruption cases that can fetch FG $74.5bn, N2.5trn’</span></a></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">“In the past, we have had elections from the top to down. I don’t know if anybody questioned that. In the past also, we have also had elections from down to top. I don’t know if anybody questioned that.”</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong> ‘Why underage persons were registered’</strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The Independent National Electoral Commission says some underage voters are being registered in some parts of the country because the lives of registration officers are being threatened by some members of the community.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The Director of Publicity and Voter Education, Mr. Oluwole Osaze-Uzzi, said this on Wednesday during a programme on the<em> African Independent Television</em> titled, ‘Kakaaki.’</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Osazze-Uzzi, while answering questions over pictures and videos on the social media showing children registering and voting in northern Nigeria, said when officials refused to register underage persons, their lives  were threatened by members of the community and they eventually caved in.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The INEC director said, “I agree that it is the responsibility of the registration officer to do that (refuse to register underage persons), but there are times that circumstances are such that where there is present and clear danger that he risks being assaulted or being killed, I think it will be unreasonable to expect him not to succumb to the pressure. But we encourage them to report immediately they get out of that dangerous zone.”</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Osazze-Uzzi said INEC had received reports from some members of the National Youth Service Corps taking part in the exercise.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">He added that parents came along with their children claiming that their children were over 18 and usually forced registration officers to register the underage children.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The INEC director said, “Even to the untrained eye, that child doesn’t look more than 15, but in such circumstances, you cannot argue too much with them. The law says the registration officer is entitled to act on some kind of identification or birth certificate or proof of age.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">“But very often, they are resisted, especially when there are lots of people there. They are challenged in a charged atmosphere and they are there without any protection. Many of them are there in strange communities which they don’t know anything about. So, there is undue pressure on them to register at this point.”</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Osaze-Uzzi, however, said mechanisms had been put in place such that after an underage person is registered, he could be removed from the register.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">He said the registers were usually inspected by senior INEC officials who could identify underage persons through their facial looks or through assistance from members of the community.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">“It is not a complex process, you display the voter register and people come there. That is in addition to the fact that the registration officer can refuse anybody registration. But we don’t expect people to risk their lives for what is essentially a simple patriotic service.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">“But if they get away with that (getting registered) and the report is not taken, the second opportunity is when the register is displayed. The best opportunity is where higher officials physically look at each register as much as they can and those who are clearly not qualified are removed. So, it is a three-pronged process and there are different stages,” the INEC director added.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">He said the process of registration and voting could never be perfect since it was a human endeavour.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">He, however, said the media and members of the public should assist the commission by exposing such cases of underage registration and voting.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Osaze-Uzzi said, “I think the law recognises that being a human endeavour, it may not be perfect and that is why it gives some kind of leeway such that when you weigh everything together, it is a reflection of what the people have chosen.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">“If one per cent of the register has underage persons; will this affect the outcome? We agree that the register is the very foundation of every election and what we can do and what the media can do is that when we get these reports and we have a fair idea of where this issue is prevalent, we can look at the registers again, look at those who are clearly underage and try to weed them out and prevent them from exercising a franchise that does not belong to them legally.”</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The INEC director maintained that the local government election which held in Kano State was not organised by INEC but the state government.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">He assured members of the public that the 2019 general elections would be free, fair and credible.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>INEC can’t be trusted with 2019 elections </strong>–PDP</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The Peoples Democratic Party has accused the Independent National Electoral Commission of being responsible for the registration of underage voters in Kano State.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Pictures and videos of the voters recently went viral on social media shortly after the conduct of local government election in the state on Saturday.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The PDP consequently said Nigerians had lost confidence in the commission.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">It added that the commission could not be trusted with the conduct of the 2019 general elections.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The former ruling party alleged that the documented “massive underage voting that characterised the exercise” was an indication that the commission was part of the fraud.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The party said it was INEC that registered the minors as voters and as such should not exonerate itself of involvement in the electoral fraud.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The PDP National Publicity Secretary, Mr. Kola Ologbondiyan, in a statement in Abuja on Wednesday, said the press release by INEC, exonerating itself from culpability in the participation of minors in the Kano election showed that INEC under Prof. Mahmood Yakubu was unreliable.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The statement read in part, “Who is fooling who? Is it not INEC that registered the minors and issued Permanent Voter Cards to them to participate in elections as documented in the Kano council election?</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">“Can INEC truly acquit itself as the culprit who set the stage for the eventual participation of the minors and overall rigging of the elections?</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">“By resorting to lame excuses and trying to exonerate itself at a time it should be taking decisive steps to protect the sanctity of its sensitive materials such as the PVC, this INEC has shown that it cannot be relied upon as a responsible and trustworthy electoral umpire.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">“Indeed, if this INEC was serious about the sanctity of sensitive electoral materials, by now it should have ordered the immediate review of its voter register in Kano and Katsina states, fishing out and prosecuting those who registered the minors and clean up the electoral system in the affected states.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">“Viewed alongside a series of numerous other irregularities being allowed by INEC to favour the ruling All Progressives Congress, including alleged conspiracy with APC-controlled security operatives to intimidate opposition members and manipulate elections as witnessed in the Mashi/Dutsi Federal Constituency Supplementary election in Katsina State, any reasonable person will decide that INEC, as presently constituted, has serious questions to answer, especially as we approach the 2019 general elections.”</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Ologbondiyan warned that Nigerians would not accept anything less than a credible, free and fair general election in 2019.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">“The commission should ensure that it does not allow itself to be used by the APC against the will of the people, particularly in the 2019 elections, as such will be resisted,” he added.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Meanwhile, the National Chairman of the party, Uche Secondus, alleged that the Federal Government was not ready for free and fair elections in 2019.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Secondus spoke when he received members of the International Republican Institute in his office in Abuja.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The team was led by the President of IRI, Mr. Dan Twining.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Secondus said, “Our major concern with the party in power is that they are not ready a for free and fair election and the best Nigerians want is  afree and fair election.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">“The people of Nigeria are passing through challenges like killings by herdsmen, insecurity, bad economy and inability to protect lives and property of Nigerians by the government.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">“Our major concern is for INEC to conduct a free and fair election because if the 2019 election is rigged, it will be a recipe for crisis.”</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Twining told Secondus that Nigerian was the most important country for IRI in sub-Saharan Africa.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">He said the group had been in the country for the past 20years, adding that IRI would want to work with political parties in order to make them responsible to the citizens of Nigeria.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Copyright PUNCH.</strong><strong><br />\n</strong><em>All rights reserved.

For the avoidance of doubt, the Supreme Court is clear on this in the case of INEC versus Musa and others (2003). In a judgment delivered by His Lordship, the former Chief Justice of Nigeria, Justice Mohammed Uwais (retd.), the apex court declared that any guidelines, be it Independent National Electoral Commission’s electoral guidelines, civil service rule or the Electoral Act, that bars civil servants from belonging to political parties is inconsistent with Section 40 of the 1999 Constitution.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">“This section clearly provides that ‘every person shall be entitled to assemble freely and associate with other persons, and in particular he may form or belong to any political party, trade union or any other association for the protection of his interests.’</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">“By belonging to a political party, civil servants will also be in a position to block the nomination of leaders, who do not care about their welfare.”</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">He said the National Assembly was working on removing the restrictions on electronic voting from the electoral laws to enable technology to play greater role in creating more credible and transparent electoral process which would reduce election petitions.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The lawmaker, however, stressed that the credibility of any electoral process starts with a free, fair and credible primary election.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Ekweremadu added, “Unfortunately, our political parties still operate manual membership registers that are largely unreliable and obsolete.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">“To get their primaries right, political parties should upgrade to both electronic register and electronic voting systems.

under the aegis of Egbe Amofin, have distanced themselves from the decision reached at the just-concluded meeting of the Eastern Bar Forum in Port Harcourt where a presidential candidate was adopted for the upcoming Nigerian Bar Association national election.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The body, in a statement on Wednesday, said it could not have been represented at the EBF meeting, since it had not held any meeting of its own in the last three years.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">It said since the demise of “our revered leader, Chief Bandele Aiku (SAN), and the fallout of the adoption brouhaha preceding the 2014 NBA national election” Egbe Amofin “has technically ceased to exist.”</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">It recalled that Egbe Amofin had run into trouble due to its failure to present a concessus presidential candidate for the 2014 NBA national election among “three  highly-respected and well-qualified candidates of our extraction who contested after the issue of adopting a single candidate for the office of the President of NBA could not be achieved after several meetings of Egbe Amofin and Elders of Yoruba.”</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">It noted that the issue was not ironed out till Aiku died and it “regrettably  culminated in Egbe’s  inability to call a meeting to even discuss Chief Aiku’s final burial rites.”</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The body, therefore, said Mr. Ranti Ajeleti could not have represented it at the EBF meeting in Port Harcourt and adopted any candidate, as he did not consult with the elders of Egbe Amofin, particularly Chief Wole Olanipekun (SAN), who was deputy to the late Aiku.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">It said, “Chief Gboyega Awomolo (SAN), Chief Femi Falana (SAN), the only state governor among us in Egbe, Governor of Ondo State, Arakunrin Oluwarotimi Akeredolu (SAN), Prince Lateef Fagbemi (SAN), Mrs. Funke Adekoya (SAN), Asiwaju Niyi Akintola (SAN) and Chief Emmanuel Abiodun, were not  consulted” by Ajeleti.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">It reiterated that “it was never the tradition  of Egbe Amofin that Yoruba lawyers will ratify candidates of other fora  in foreign land.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">“The tradition is that whatever the decision of any regional group within the NBA, like the EBF, such decision will be communicated to Egbe in writing and shall be discussed at a general meeting or the meeting of elders before a decision is taken.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">“The Yoruba lawyers did not adopt any candidate at the last election because the procedure/conditions for such exercise were not met by the Arewa Lawyers Forum, whose turn it was to produce the President.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">“The adoption  ratified by Mr. Ranti Ajeleti was done in his personal capacity and lacks the support of Yoruba lawyers.”</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Copyright PUNCH.</strong><strong><br

Ibrahim Babangida (retd.), to join what he called the retirees’ club and be collecting pensions.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Tinubu spoke with State House correspondents shortly after he and a former interim chairman of the party, Chief Bisi Akande, met President Muhammadu Buhari at the Presidential Villa, Abuja.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">He was reacting to separate statements by the two leaders who recently advised Buhari not to seek re-election in 2019.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">While saying he does not address “those shadows,” the former Lagos State governor urged Obasanjo and Babangida to allow the present crop of leaders to move the country forward.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">“I don’t address those shadows. We should let our former Presidents join retirees’ club and take pensions but they can participate in our politics if they are interested.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">“It is a free world but this freedom is not served a la carte. They should allow us to move our country forward. It is a challenge to every Nigerian,” he said.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Despite the challenges he admitted were facing the ruling party, Tinubu said the APC would still win the 2019 elections.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">He said the party had a better chance and was determined to organise the most transparent election.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">When asked about the chances of the APC in 2019, the party leader said, “You are asking me an obvious question. I belong to this party. My commitment is to this party. We have a better chance and we are strongly determined to prosecute the elections in a most transparent and democratic manner and we will win.”</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Tinubu said he had already started work on the assignment given to him by Buhari to reconcile aggrieved party members across the country.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">He described conflict resolution as part of the democratic process.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">He added, “I feel greatly honoured with the confidence that the President has reposed in me which is a very strong political challenge. We have started in earnest. He has given me the free hand to put coercion, confidence and trust in the party.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">“Democracy is about conflict resolution. You can’t do it without resolving conflicts. We can’t build it without understanding the conflicts and sources where we are coming from. But we want to leave the country with a legacy.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">“It’s not about Mr. President. That is what he’s telling the country.  It’s about our country and no other choice to democratic tenets than through political party platforms.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">“He is one of those rare beings around the country, around Africa who had experienced both worlds: he fought a battle to save Nigeria and came to politics to save Nigeria. Very rare people have such an opportunity in their lifetime and that’s what we talk about legacy, and where we have all the challenges, do what we should do.

That was why I didn’t consider how wealthy or poor he was before I allowed him to marry my daughter even at the level God has placed me. I saw the hand of God in the whole thing. He has a future for himself. He has sincerity of purpose. He means well.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">“Uche Nwosu possesses all the qualities to be a good governor.

We don’t rely on that,” he said.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The Bauchi State Governor, Mohammed Abubakar, said they were at the Presidential Villa for a dialogue on ethics and integrity of service and the presentation of a compendium on the life and times of President Muhammadu Buhari and the service he had rendered to the nation, from the time he joined the army to date.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Abubakar also supported the establishment of state police, saying the fear that state governors would abuse it was unfounded.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">He said, “The nation is a federation. The constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria provides for a federal system and in a federal system, the federating units are all independent in their own sphere of influence.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">“We copied the constitution from the American Constitution and if you go to America, you discover that there is county police; there is state police and then the federal police. If we are going to engender true federalism, that is probably the beginning.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">“There will always be fears but we should not think in terms of individuals in Nigeria, that is our bane. We should think in terms of developing institutions. When we develop institutions and the plain truth, they take care of the indiscretions of individuals.”</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Copyright PUNCH.</em><br />\n</strong>All rights reserved.

Alani Akinrinade, has said that restructuring is unavoidable and inevitable for Nigeria in the face of national consensus which has coalesced around the issue.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The former Chief of Army Staff from October 1979 to April 1980, therefore, called on the Federal Government to take immediate steps towards restructuring the country in the best interest of the citizenry.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Akinrinade expressed these positions on Monday in Yenagoa, the Bayelsa State capital, while delivering a lecture, titled, ‘Restructuring and the Dawn of a new Nigeria’ as part of the activities marking the sixth anniversary of Governor Seriake Dickson.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Proponents of restructuring, who formed a panel of discussants  include, a former governor of Anambra State, Dr. Chukwuemeka Ezeife; President of the Arewa Youth Consultative Forum, Mr. Shettima Yerima; Spokesman for Afenifere, Yinka Odumakin; and the founding President, Nigeria Oral Literature Association, Prof. Godini Darah.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">While stressing the need for state police, Akinrinade particularly urged President Muhammadu Buhari to initiate a bill to unbundle the overburdened centre by removing some of the items in the current Exclusive List.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">“In the last few weeks, a national consensus seems to have coalesced around the issue. Restructuring is unavoidable and inevitable for Nigeria. It is not a done deal yet; neither are the procedures and modus operandi cast in marble.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">“But with the All Progressives Congress committee on the subject turning in one of many of the cardinal imperatives of restructuring report with a bold approval and the Peoples Democratic Party buying substantially into the project through its legislative caucus, a new vista of bi-partisan cooperation has been opened.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">“If we cast our mind to the recent battle for restructuring in Nigeria, we see all the rich ironies of history in slow motion. Four years ago as the battle for the restructuring of the nation raged unabated, then President Goodluck Jonathan convoked a National Political Conference with the express mandate to look at the grave political issues facing Nigeria and come up with an acceptable solution.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">“Given the urgency of the situation, one would have thought that the convener would have acted with express resolve once the conference turned in its report. But for reasons best known to him, Jonathan delayed and prevaricated until he was defeated in a landmark presidential election, which for the first time in the history of the nation had the opposition winning by a landslide.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">“In his own case, and as if the government is a radical discontinuum, President Muhammadu Buhari would have nothing to do with the conference report. In fact, it is on record that the former infantry officer went as far as to flatly assert that he would make sure that the report ended up in a permanent cooler – the archives. This was not just a case of benign indifference but active hostility.”</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">He recalled that the battle for restructuring had always been an intra-elite affair, noting that currently, the quest was assuming a popular dimension, reaching its highest decibel of hype and hysteria with the struggle for ethnic self-determination by the IPOB and other groups.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">He said what began as a cry of marginalisation had morphed into a bitter separatist drive and called for a national referendum to determine the status of the union.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Akinrinade added, “The blunt fact remains that this renewed ethnic restiveness is a vote against centralised tyranny and inefficiency as well as the ethnicisation of the Presidency, which have become the hallmark of the Nigerian post-colonial state particularly in the Fourth Republic.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">“Successful elections and the restriction of the military to the barracks have failed to resolve the National Question. In fact elections, including a historic regime change, have tended to exacerbate the regional and ethnic fault lines, opening the door to a resurgence of primordial sentiments and new centrifugal forces.”</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Also speaking, Dickson reaffirmed his position that restructuring held the key to preserving the unity, stability and economic prosperity of the country.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Dickson said those championing the restructuring crusade were the true patriots of an egalitarian, just and fair Nigeria.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">He called on all well-meaning Nigerians to support the restructuring movement towards actualising the Nigerian project.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">He said, “Those in support of restructuring and constitutional amendment to address the imbalances in our nation are indeed believers in the Nigerian project and not the other way round.”</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Also, Ezeife, Yerima, Odumakin and Darah, who formed the panel of discussants during the lecture, emphasised the need for more interactions amongst Nigerians particularly the northern people to assuage the fears and misconceptions surrounding the issue of restructuring.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Copyright PUNCH.</em><br />\n</strong>All rights reserved.

we re-ordered election timetable – Rep"},content:{rendered:'<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>John Ameh, Abuja</strong></em></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">A member of the House of Representatives, Mr. Douye Diri, said on Monday that the real reason the National Assembly changed the sequence of elections ahead of the 2019 polls was  to stop other candidates from riding on the popularity of the President to win their own contests.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"> The Senate and the House, in their recent amendments to the Electoral Act 2010, changed the sequence of elections by making the presidential poll to come last.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"> Until now, the presidential and the National Assembly elections were first conducted, followed by others.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"> But in the re-ordered amendment to the law, the National Assembly elections will come first, followed by governorship and the presidential poll coming last.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"> Diri, who is from Bayelsa State, argued that the old order favoured unpopular candidates to get into power by simply identifying with the President or his political party.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"> He explained that the lawmakers felt that contestants should genuinely test their popularity by standing alone and not waiting in the wings to take advantage of the victory of an elected President.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"> However, independent findings by The PUNCH also showed that part of the reasons was that presidential candidates often thought that the electioneering was all about them.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"> It was learnt that lawmakers were unhappy that an elected President, in most cases, hardly fought for other contestants the moment he had won his own election.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"> Speaking further, Diri cited the case of President Muhammadu Buhari, whom he said people believed had integrity and would want to take advantage of it.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"> Dirii, who is a member of the House Committee on Electoral Matters, said, “The committee worked on the bill and we all voted on the bill in both chambers of the National Assembly.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">“You will agree with me that there were a lot of those riding on the popularity of the President, including most of us who are members of the National Assembly.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"> “So, by this separation, some of them who are not popular, who were thinking that Buhari is a man of integrity and so when I go under Buhari I will win my election, problem will come for them.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"> “These are the people who are kicking against the sequence. Not only my colleagues. As we all know, there are even governors who believe that this thing (new sequence) will be a problem to them.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"> “If you are popular, why will you be bothered that the National Assembly election would not hold the same day with that of the President?  Why are you bothered? You go on your own and do your election.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"> “So, I am really surprised when people say that there is an ulterior motive.  I don’t see any ulterior motive. I believe that those who are saying this have some skeletons in their cupboards.”</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"> Asked what would happen if the President refused to assent to the amendment, Diri said the reason for withholding the assent must be convincing enough.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"> “Both chambers have adopted it (amendment).  And if both chambers have adopted it, the President must convince both chambers as to why he is not signing it.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">“If he convinces both chambers, no problem. If we are not convinced by the reasons or if the reasons will not be in the interest of Nigeria, we would go the full hog.”</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"> Diri also gave his backing to true federalism, particularly the power of states to have their own police and to allocate land for cattle ranches as against allowing cows to roam freely.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><em> </em><strong><em>Copyright PUNCH.</em><br />\n</strong>All rights reserved.

A compulsory debate will make a great impact if we can get such a law in place before the 2019 elections because the strength of democracy and the opportunities it creates depend on the vigour of multi-party politics in terms of policy issues, debates, moral arguments and value formation. We should not be contented with just having elections after every four years without real democratic values being canvassed. In the first place, politics is about competition of ideas on how best to influence the cause of development in a country. There should be formalised platforms to canvass ideas, hence compulsory debate is the most significant platform to do so.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Do you really think that a candidate’s performance during a public debate could influence the decision of the electorate?</em></strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Nigeria is at a critical juncture and we need people who have the competencies to address issues of the economy and how to create jobs, issues of education, health, the crippling energy crisis, security and so on. A compulsory debate will reveal to the electorate who amongst the candidates has the competencies, credible ideas and capacity to deliver on them. The 2019 election debates should not be about who can abuse most or make promises (because anybody can make promises) but who can tell Nigerians how the promises on the various sectors would be achieved and how he or she will generate the resources to deliver on campaign promises. The electoral contest ideally is meant to pick people based on the voters’ perception of their competencies, policy preferences, and the attributes of their character. Voters can’t make these judgments clearly if the candidates do not debate on these policy matters and the people, having the opportunity to assess them individually as is the practice in the United States and other countries. Even if we say only parties, as entities, contest elections in Nigeria, practically, those parties will still be represented by people; those who present themselves for elections must be able to convince the public about what they are promising and how it would be achieved. The debates will also allow the voters to see those around the party and judge them by their public records, their moral and professional attributes. It may even act as a self-censoring social sieve for those who know they fall short of the competencies for the positions they are seeking and may have to pull out of the race before actual ballots are cast.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Is INEC satisfied with the progress being made on its bill at the National Assembly?</em></strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The amendments to the Constitution and Electoral Act are still work in progress. The Senate had passed its version but it is waiting for the lower chamber where there is a delay at the moment.  Meanwhile, they have this (last) month (January) by international best practices which frown on tinkering with electoral laws a year before the election date, to obviate partisan amendments. Also, the full compliments of RECs in the entire 36 states are also being awaited for Senate confirmation. Issues around election security and the need for absolute security neutrality as well as the need to avoid manipulation of the electoral process from corruption, violence and other uncertainties are expected to be addressed in the fresh amendment proposals before the federal parliament.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>What is INEC doing to address massive open vote buying on Election Day?</em></strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The growing trend of vote buying on election days is a big threat to democracy because the electorate are not really making informed choices which is a basic assumption of democracy. We do not have to go that route that other societies have travelled even though vote buying has a chequered history in the development of democracy and democratic elections globally. It is very important to closely understand the general and contextual contributions of the phenomenon in order to abate and mitigate it. In Europe and North America, when politicians used to rely on voting machines, when middle men mobilised voters with pecuniary incentives, politicians who contested later found that every election cycle made them more dependent and vulnerable, with less guarantee of assured outcome. The middlemen, who bribed voters for them, grew greedier and many politicians lost both the votes and huge fortunes. Both the political class and the society will lose in the end if such behaviour is not stopped. That was why the use of anonymous ballot papers was introduced because middlemen, who bought votes, used confirmations of how they voted to get their payments. Even recently in Italy, North Carolina and India, the use of cell phones was banned at polling centres because some voting machine gangs asked voters to send a picture of their ballot from inside the polling unit by MMS messaging to confirm their payments. We have to deal with this form of political corruption now and should not happen in elections slated for 2018 and the 2019 general elections.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Copyright PUNCH.</em><br />\n</strong>All rights reserved.

a former Deputy Senate President, Ibrahim Mantu, and Senator Paul Zannan.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Other prominent northern leaders at the event are a former governor of Niger State, Dr. Babangida Aliyu; Senator Bala Mande and Senator Solomon Ewuga.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">A former Vice-Chancellor of the Ahmadu Bello University, Zaria, Prof. Ango Abdullahi; a former governor of Sokoto State, Alhaji Attahiru Bafarawa;

Our meeting was not to support any candidate; we don’t even know the candidates yet. The purpose is to see how to bring about unity of purpose in the North.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">“Our main preoccupation is how to unite the North to relate better with the rest of Nigeria on a common ground.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">“We are a political group but non-partisan (almost) all political parties were here, we are fighting for unity of the country we are not having anybody in mind, we want to have a common purpose.”</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Mohammed, who is also a former Minister of Defence, in his speech, said the forum was convened “after due consideration of the current political situation in the country.”</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">He stated, “After due consideration of the current political situation in the country, it becomes highly expedient to convene a conversation of critical Northern Elders and Stakeholders to deliberate on the best way forward for the region.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">“The conversation was necessitated by the need for us to deliberate and reach an acceptable choice for representation, given that the 2019 Presidency has been zoned to the North.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">“From what is apparent in the political arena today, it is clear that the major political operators have agreed that in the forthcoming 2019 general elections, it is the turn of the North to produce the President.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">“From what we have seen earlier, it has always been zoned to the North but the decision on what to do and who to present has never been a northern decision.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">“What we want is that this time round, let us have the opportunity to come together so that whatever is decided for the North, it is the northern leaders who decide it and then we get support from other regions.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">“If we are able to do that, then we should be able to produce a leadership for this country that would be just, equitable and lead us to nation’s development which is eluding us. That is the reason why we are here.”</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">In a communiqué at the end of the meeting, the elders and stakeholders stated that they agreed to set up a committee to search and present a consensus candidate for the 2019 presidential election.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">They equally set up a committee to look at the desirability or otherwise of the restructuring of Nigeria just as they approved the holding of a political summit, tagged ‘Northern Political Submit’  on March 15, 2018.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">They said this was to commemorate the attainment of self-government of the Northern region in 1959.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">They blamed governors for most of the problems in the region and called for efforts to reduce their powers.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The communiqué released to the media by chairman of the Communiqué Drafting Committee, Senator Ibrahim Mantu, showed that the group also set up other committees, top among which was the one saddled with the responsibility of x-raying factors that had caused crises in the region.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The communique read, “This meeting is hereby established as a standing forum for the Northern Region to be known as Northern Political Leaders Forum.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">“Five Sub-Committees are hereby set up to address the various issues challenging the Northern Region.

Do you agree?</em></strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">I was in Benue of recent to see things for myself, to sympathise and empathise with my brother, friend and colleague, Governor (Samuel) Ortom, and the people of Benue State. I saw what happened and I appealed to the Federal Government to still do more. They might be doing something but there is still a lot of room for improvement. Last Friday, killings were still going on both in Taraba and Benue states. I can understand that both Taraba and Benue states have borders on River Benue and the herdsmen need water for their cattle, but that is not a basis for the kind of carnage going on. Government has a lot of responsibility to look in this direction. If this issue is not properly handled, it might throw a very strong spanner into the unity of this country.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The issue in Benue is very unfortunate because the Fulani herdsmen have been with us for ages, even before I was born. I know going by the history of this country, there are cattle routes. Both farmers and Fulani herdsmen have been living peacefully, observing these routes. However, so many factors have led to the blockage of some of the routes. Cattle route now is no longer feasible due to increase in population but that does not mean that the herdsmen should resort to carnage.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Sometime in 2012, when the PDP was in power, I made a suggestion when similar situation started in Plateau State. I presented a paper to the then Federal Executive Council.  My observation was that this was beyond cattle men fighting farmers because the kind of sophisticated weapons being used by the herdsmen are beyond the reach of an ordinary Fulani herdsman. I also observed that the ways, the methods they used to kill their victims like cutting off their heads, removing vital organs and opening up  the wombs of pregnant women were similar to that of Boko Haram. That is the pattern of the killings by ISIS. I suggested that the security agencies should look in that direction. I am happy that I am telling the whole world now; maybe government kept it as a secret. The security agency by then met me a month later to say that I was right but I don’t know why the security agencies have not looked in that direction up till today despite the fact that the killings are still taking place. I believe as humans, there must be empathy, sympathy and sense of feeling. I remember vividly when former President Barack Obama of the United States had to cut short his visit to India because there were shootings in a school in the US and a few pupils were killed while several others were injured. Obama cut short his visit to India and returned home to visit that school. That alone is enough to soothe the wounded souls of their parents. That is what I expected our President to do in the case of Benue too.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Former President Obasanjo, in his recent statement, accused President Muhammadu Buhari of running a government of nepotism and favouritism as regards alleged lopsidedness in the President’s appointments. Do you agree with Obasanjo?</em></strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Obasanjo has his reasons. He is an elder statesman. He is entitled to his reasons. Maybe this question should have been directed to him. Maybe he would have been able to give details of what he meant by good governance, ineptitude, nepotism and so on. He might see what we do not see. It is not possible for all of us to see what Obasanjo saw and he is still seeing. To me, the executive should have listened to and discuss with someone like him, whose views are respected not only in Nigeria but internationally. If you look at the trend of the contributions of Chief Obasanjo to the polity in the country, this is not the first, second or third time he would write letters. He wrote letters even in 1983 when (Shehu) Shagari was in power. He also wrote to President (Goodluck) Jonathan when he was in power. If he is coming around with another letter, it is his own way of sending some signals to a government in power, negative or positive.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">I think what Obasanjo has seen both in the past and now, judging by events, some of the issues he raised in such letters have come to pass. President Buhari should take it seriously. He should not take the words of sycophants and praise singers, who want to lick boots or gain by whatever criticism they have taken into consideration. President Buhari should look very vividly into that letter and call Obasanjo to a roundtable and say, ‘What have you seen? You supported me before I got here’ because I know Obasanjo gave him a lot of support. He should call him and discuss with him. That is politics. It is not about segregation. This country belongs to all of us. So, if anybody has anything to do or to contribute to the progress and positive change, I think he should bring him. If I have an opportunity to write a letter too, maybe, I will write one.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Are  you aware of a plot to remove Senate President, Bukola Saraki, from office? </em></strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">We heard the rumour but the party has not made a statement about it. But if it is true, can they remove him? There must be grounds before you remove somebody like him from office, and they (senators) have their own rules and regulations and we all know that there are constitutions that guide impeachment.  To the best of my knowledge, I don’t think any Senate President in the past, in the immediate past or long past, has held the Senate like Saraki has been holding it. He (Saraki) is seen to be a team player; he is seen to be a leader that carries the Senate along and he is seen to be somebody who can endure, give and sacrifice for this nation. He got to that position as if he was fighting a war. Those who opposed him are the most fanatical people who are his supporters today. So, what reason do you have to impeach such a person? I’m aware there are a lot of gimmicks, but the worst one that would boomerang against anybody who is planning anything is to say they want to remove Saraki.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>There are views that people like Saraki have sympathy for the PDP which has affected the relationship between the executive and the legislature. What is your reaction to this?</em></strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">You are all living witnesses to the way the Senate President is being treated in this country. Saraki is the number three citizen. I believe that the court of law reserved the right to prove somebody innocent or guilty. But there is a lot of what I would describe as undesirable politicking going on and I do not think that the APC should have allowed itself to have got into this kind of unhealthy politicking. Saraki is a formidable force in the Senate; today, not only in the Senate, Saraki as the Chairman of the National Assembly is highly respected, accepted and somebody that they think has provided a sense of direction for the NASS like never before. So if the Buhari-led APC government wants to achieve its objectives and vision, it must cooperate with the National Assembly especially the Senate.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>You have been quiet since you joined others to lead a faction of the Peoples Democratic Party on a mass exodus from the party to the APC. What happened? </em></strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">I would not agree with the assertion that I have kept quiet. I have granted some interviews; one in 2015 and another in 2016. I said we wanted to start governance, and that I would not speak for some time to come. That was my position when I had my last interview.  We were making efforts to ensure that we kept our promises to the people but a lot of factors affected our efforts; the President’s illness was one. Also, some observations by our key members about our relevance in the party were also issues, I must confess.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>There are reports that the APC has made you irrelevant after your defection. Is this correct?   </em></strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">It is not correct to say that the APC has made me irrelevant; that is not correct. I am still a member of the Board of Trustees of the party, and today, my views are not brushed aside. But sincerely, we are making a lot of sacrifices as we went a little bit quiet so that our party can solidify and Nigeria can move forward. Some would argue that I decided to keep a little bit quiet because I was dissatisfied with the way the party or the government is running the party. I cannot tell you categorically that I am reasonably satisfied with everything that is going on in the APC because there are some things that we are not doing well.  I think the party needs a lot of ‘panel beating’ in order to remain focused and pursue the desires of the electorate and Nigerians at large.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Former Vice-President Atiku Abubakar, before he returned to the PDP, said the APC had abandoned him. Have you also been abandoned by the party?</em></strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">I think the word ‘abandon’ is too strong. I would rather say that the party is still finding its feet and it has not been easy for it. It could be as a result of the method being used by the leadership to administer the party.  Whatever the case, I believe that four years might not be enough to describe the party as either strong or weak. However, if the party is moving in the right direction, then the likes of Atiku might still be there.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Why is your party still blaming the PDP for its inability to meet the expectations of the people, almost three years in power? </em></strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">When the opposition, the PDP, throws stones, I do not expect the APC to keep quiet. The reply should not be regarded as shifting blame or passing the buck. In any case, those of us, who are coming from the PDP, are used to it. When we were there in the PDP, we knew the opposition then never saw anything good in the PDP. It could be the same way too with the PDP now.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Looking at the APC manifesto, would you say that your party has fulfilled the promises it made to Nigerians?</em></strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">I want to say to a great extent that the President (Muhammadu Buhari) has made a lot of efforts, particularly in some cardinal areas that we promised Nigerians. First, in the areas of security, Boko Haram was at its peak when we came into power in 2015. One of our promises to Nigerians was that if we were voted in, we would subdue the activities of the dreaded criminals. Today, we are all living witnesses that the Nigerian military has done a very fine job. However, insurgency is a war that is difficult to end because it comes in various tactics.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Are you aware that the majority of Nigerians are suffering and lamenting that they voted your party into power in 2015?</em></strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">I am aware that people are not comfortable. If I say I am not aware, I am being insincere. When people are not comfortable, definitely, they look for alternatives, right? It is left for the APC as a party to accept that people are not comfortable. If the APC accepts that people are not comfortable, then they must look for solutions. If they do not look for solutions, whatever results they get will be their own responsibility. The APC is barely five years old; if Nigerians think that there is a need for a change of political party, let them go to the poll and use the ballot paper.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Copyright PUNCH.</em><br />\n</strong>All rights reserved.

Those in this school of thought argue that, unlike in 2015, when the APC played its role as a vibrant opposition party and eventually defeated an incumbent Peoples Democratic Party, the opposition today lacks the cohesion to replicate this feat. In contrast, supporters of the PDP insist that there is no time in the history of the ruling APC that it is more vulnerable than now.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">In Nigeria, like most American-style system of government, winning the presidential election is considered the ultimate prize. Arguably, the decision of the then incumbent President Goodluck Jonathan, a southern minority politician, to seek re-election in spite of an unwritten agreement not to do so, sparked off a chain of events which ultimately led to PDP’s ouster from power.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Times have, however, changed. President Muhammadu Buhari, who became the ultimate beneficiary of the chaos which followed the loss of cohesion within the then PDP, has a different set of challenges to contend with should he seek re-election come 2019.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Although Buhari is yet to make a formal announcement of his desire to return to power in 2019, there are strong indications that he is interested in a second term in Aso Rock.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The appointment of the Minister of Transportation, Rotimi Ameachi, as the Director-General of the 2019 Buhari Campaign &#8211;which has not been denied, has removed any iota of doubt that it is only a matter of time before a formal announcement is made.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Buhari’s historic victory in 2015 was made largely possible by a combination of factors. They include, but not limited to, his personality; public discontent with the massive looting of the public treasury in the Jonathan’s government; the near collapse of security in the country and infighting among key stakeholders of the ruling Peoples Democratic Party.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The icing on the cake was the ability of major opposition parties to come together to form the APC.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">There were early signs that the control of the APC machinery by contending power blocks will lead to a war of attrition, but very few seemed to have paid attention to this. When Senator Bukola Saraki and Yakubu Dogara, who joined the APC from the PDP, outsmarted the APC leadership to emerge as Senate President and Speaker of the House of Representatives respectively, only a few political pundits predicted correctly that recovery from this act of political rebellion would take a while.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Matters were made worse by Buhari’s strange aloofness from the party.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Second Republic member of the House of Representatives, Dr. Junaid Mohammed, said, “As soon as he became President, Buhari abandoned the party. He surrounded himself with relatives and individuals who contributed next to nothing to the party’s electoral victory. Party members, some of whom hold positions of authority, were left to do as they pleased.”</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Matters were further complicated by the President’s long absence due to health challenges and his inability to take action against close aides and associates accused of corruption.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Buhari, who is eligible to seek a re-election in 2019, has a new set of challenges to contend with should he decide to run.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Infighting among major stakeholders has become the order of the day within the APC. It is, perhaps, in recognition of this fact that Buhari recently named Asiwaju Bola Tinubu to lead efforts to reconcile aggrieved party members. This, however, has its own set of challenges. A leading member of the party, who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of retribution, stated, “Tinubu is the chief aggrieved person. Some of us feel he was used and dumped and his political capital among some of his loyalists has been depleted.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">“Worse of all, some of his lieutenants, who rebelled against him were empowered to give him a bloody nose in local elections in a place like Ondo. How do you explain what also happened in Kogi?</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">“I don’t think it would be wrong to assert that Tinubu’s task can best be described as mission impossible considering the time frame.”</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The source recalled that Tinubu had never hidden his disappointment and dislike for the National Chairman of the APC, Chief John Odigie-Oyegun. “What President Buhari has done is simply to give Tinubu a blank cheque to do as he pleases as long as he puts the party back in shape to win in 2019,” the source added.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The former Lagos State governor’s mission which, according to party insiders, is without prejudice to ongoing efforts by the party’s National Working Committee, is without doubt herculean; likely to be his toughest challenge yet.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The crisis of confidence between elements within the Presidency, the party and the leadership of the National Assembly, especially the Senate, will be a test case of how politically savvy the Jagaban of Borgu can be. This is aside from the fact that Kano, which is Buhari’s political fortress, is in turmoil owing to the war of attrition between Governor Abdulllahi Ganduje and his predecessor, Senator Rabiu Kwankwaso.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Several state chapters of the APC are also contending with internal squabble. Prominent among these states are Kogi, Bauchi, Gombe, Kaduna and Enugu, just to mention a few. A resolution of these disputes is required to reposition the party if it must retain power.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">A public affairs analyst and Executive Director of the Civil Society Legislative and Advocacy Centre, Mr. Auwal Musa, expressed the opinion that the President must also act to halt the drift caused by un-elected individuals around him.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">“Some of these individuals have been linked to allegations of shady deals right under the President’s watch,” he said.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The growing security threats occasioned by the wanton killings and destruction of property by killer herdsmen in the North-Central states of Benue, Plateau, Taraba and Kaduna, are also some of the major challenges staring the President in the face. Aside from his promise to deal with corruption, the President promised to secure the lives and property of Nigerians and improve the economy.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">On the issue of the economy, a one-time member of the Board of the Nigerian Railways, Mr. Abdullahi Jalo, said, “Despite the propaganda by paid agents of this administration, I know Nigerians are asking questions. Are we better off now than we were in 2015? Despite claims of job creation, how many jobs have been lost? Politics aside, something has to happen to improve the economy if the President wants to seek re-election.”</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Making inroads into the South-East, where he has had a long history of electoral defeats, is another challenge Buhari must surmount. Apart from his perceived marginalisation of the zone in terms of political appointments, a large number of easterners still hold an impression that the President’s thoughts towards them are “thoughts of evil and not of good.”</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The Director-General of Voice of Nigeria, a stalwart of the APC from the zone, Osita Okechukwu, has a different opinion of the issue. According to him, while it is true that the South-East appears to have been marginalised, especially in terms of appointments, the President has made up for this oversight in the area of development projects.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">He said, “Today, this administration, which has not appointed as many south-easterners as the previous regime, has more than any administration in Nigeria’s history, committed itself to key infrastructural development projects such as railway lines, roads and the construction of the second Niger Bridge which has been abandoned for years.”</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Speaking about permutations about Buhari’s chances in 2019, Elder statesman, Tanko Yakassai, explained that the dynamics vary from one part of the country to the other. He said, “In the North for instance, we should understand that there are so many people that will not have won elections had Buhari not contested in 2015.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">“I cannot estimate in terms of percentage of the people who voted for Buhari in 2015; but I can say at least 50 per cent in urban areas are disappointed with his performance.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">“The Yoruba people in the South-West are result-oriented people. They are sentimental in a different way. The sentimentalism of the Yoruba is such that, they can support you to get to office but that support cannot be guaranteed when you disappoint them.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">“Another factor which should be taken into consideration is the fact that there is no longer the urge for power shift like we had in 2015. At that time, most of the people in the North just wanted power to return to the North. It came back to the North but if anything, we are worse off. People who thought that by voting Buhari, their lives will automatically be better now know better.”</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">A notable northern elite, Junaid Mohammed, however expressed a slightly different opinion.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">He said, “If the APC presents Buhari as its candidate, like I know it will, unless they (officials) rig, he will not win a re-election because he has performed woefully by all standards.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The South-South National Vice-Chairman of the APC, Hilliard Eta, on his part said, “As far as I am concerned, the 2019 election has been won and lost. With Buhari as our candidate, our victory is sure.”</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Apart from what some people and opposition have described as the current administration’s woeful performance; the seeming reluctance of Aso Rock to tame the unending killings by Fulani cattle rearers and the controversial reinstatement into office of some of Buhari’s kinsmen accused of corrupt practices, the President will need to convince the international community and some of the nation’s power brokers that the support he enjoyed in 2015 has not been misplaced.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Overcoming his health challenges and winning back the hearts and minds of Nigerians are perhaps the greatest challenges Buhari must surmount should he decide to seek re-election.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Copyright PUNCH.</em><br />\n</strong>All rights reserved.

He talks about his father’s life and political career with <strong>TOLUWANI ENIOLA</strong></em></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Tell us briefly about yourself.</em></strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">I am a civil engineer by training. I am in my late 20s. I attended Kaduna International School and then proceeded to Adesoye College, Offa, Kwara State for my secondary education. I attended the University of Greenwich, London, for undergraduate and master’s degree. I am currently studying for my PhD at the same institution. I am an entrepreneur and currently own FAMCO Group of Companies.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>How do you feel being the child of a former governor?</em></strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">My father has all the qualities that I think every good father should have. He is honest, courageous, hardworking, disciplined and determined in achieving his goals.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>What childhood memories can you recall with your father?</em></strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Some of my fond memories include travelling together as a family. I guess the happiness of spending some quality time with him made most of my childhood memories of him a special one.  Then, it’s strictly family time. We talked on a variety of topics. There was always a joke or two to laugh about. My brothers, sisters or mother would have a story or two. It’s always fun when we are all together. But of course, my best moments are always when I do very well in school and there will always be pride in the way he talks about it.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">There was a time when I was, maybe seven or eight years old; I had a terrible flu which made me unable to breathe properly. He asked my mother to get him some hot water. He put some menthol in the water and sat me down. He covered me up to inhale the mint steam. After that, he rubbed some menthol all over my chest and made sure I had clear airways. Till date, I do that when I have a terrible cold.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>How often did he visit you when you were in school?</em></strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">He visited me as often as time allowed.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>How did he discipline you when you misbehaved?</em></strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The ‘eye’ of course! There was no corporal punishment from him. My father isn’t the type of man you would want to disappoint; so, misbehaving wasn’t really an option for me.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>What punishment can you recall that he gave you when you did wrong?</em></strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Honestly, none that I can remember. As I said, as his children, we never want to disappoint him.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>How does he create time for his family despite his tight schedule?</em></strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">My father is not just my father alone; he is also a man of the people. Basically, anytime I need him, he doesn’t waste a second.  He is always there. Besides, he devotes time on a regular basis to talk to the family.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Considering your privileged background, were you pampered?</em></strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">I had a well-disciplined upbringing. I had sound basics that mostly included good education, which hardworking parents try hard to give their children. While growing up, I was made to understand the difference between wants and needs. I got my needs but had to work very hard for my wants and still did not always get them. Another lesson I learnt is that in life, you do not always get what you want no matter how badly you want it.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>What did your father tell you about politics?  </em></strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">My father has the golden rule which says, “Everything in its own time.” As I was growing up, his main advice to me was to work hard and get good grades in school. As an adult, he gave me an opportunity to know about politics.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>If your father was not a politician, what would he have become?</em></strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">He would have been an academic!</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>What kind of man was he at home when you were growing up?</em></strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">He is soft-spoken, organised, cheerful and jovial, most especially when discussing business or life in general.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>What were the lessons he taught you about life?</em></strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">He told me that integrity cannot be bought.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>What are your father’s worst and best moments?</em></strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">His worst moment is when he loses something or someone close to his heart. His best moments are when he sees people succeeding or his children attain milestones.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>What are his favourite food and drink?</em></strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">His favourite food is pounded yam and <em>egusi</em> soup. Water tastes best for him.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Why do you think he likes pounded yam and egusi considered as Yoruba food?</em></strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">My father was just born in the North to northern parents, but at heart, he is a Yoruba and Igbo man. He is a man of the people. So, don’t be surprised that he likes delicacies like pounded yam and egusi. He also likes <em>isi ewu</em> (goat meat). He socialises with the Igbo culture more perhaps because he attended the Federal Government College, Enugu, for his secondary education.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>What is his best music?</em></strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">I can’t really recall but I presume he likes old school songs.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>How does he exercise?</em></strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">He likes taking a walk.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>What are his likes and dislikes?</em></strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">He likes peace and dislikes incompetence, laziness and dishonesty.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>How do your friends react the first time they know who your father is?</em></strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Well, I get the “oh yes! You look exactly like him!” and I still get those responses when I meet new people.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Does your father’s name open doors for you?</em></strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Not in the material manner. But then, when I meet people and they hear he is my father, they treat me with respect. To be honest, because my father wouldn’t allow any sort of cutting corners just because I am his child; In fact, I get extorted by people most of the time than being favoured.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>What are the things people do not know about your father?</em></strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">From the day he was born, his people considered him as their lucky charm because his birth ushered in prosperity and happiness.  He likes to drive and even now, he drives himself on his personal errands. He became a successful entrepreneur at a young age.  His humble background reflects in every aspect of his life. He is a passionate adventurer.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>What is his assessment of the current administration, especially on the state of the economy, federalism and herdsmen killings?</em></strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">He thinks that the people voted because they were dissatisfied with the last administration. The problems of our economy are a lot more structural and have been with us for a long time. Instead of apportioning blame, Nigerians should come together and salvage our country. Therefore, if it is a failure, it is a collective thing.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">There is a demand for restructuring and rearrangement of the country which our political leaders and all others that are stakeholders across the nation should take seriously. The herdsmen attacks, leading to the killing of innocent and harmless people, are worrisome. The current administration needs to maintain the successes achieved during the 2015 elections in the North-East to avoid the regrouping of deadly groups.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Can you share your father’s most challenging period while climbing the ladder of his career?</em></strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">He is a man who started from nothing to achieve what he is today. Every step of the way was challenging.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>What role did your father play in your career choice?</em></strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">None at all! I made my choice without any sort of influence from him and he supported me all the way.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>How does your father relax?</em></strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">He finds joy in spending time with his friends over dinner, watching football or playing golf.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>What is his opinion of President Muhammadu Buhari’s administration, anti-corruption war and Biafra agitation?</em></strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">I would suggest you ask him that personally.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Who are those your father considers his role models?</em></strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">He has always admired Nigeria’s founding fathers for inspiration in his life.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Who are your dad’s best friends?</em></strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">I think his childhood friends are Alhaji Safiyanu and Dr. Omoniyi Bu’ari.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>What are his secrets of keeping healthy?</em></strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">He lives a disciplined lifestyle without overindulging in anything.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>What lessons have you learnt from your father?</em></strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">He taught me that education is important; and encouraged me to attain the highest level I can and that every other thing will fall into place. He believes in the power of words. He taught me to guard my tongue because words, when uttered, cannot be taken back. He taught me how to give back to my people and the community. He taught me to be disciplined and punctual, for time is priceless.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Did you enjoy any special treatment from friends at the time your father was governor?</em></strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Not really! No.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Did he spend time with his family when he was Kaduna State governor?</em></strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">I think he tried his best. He created as much time as every governor had to spend time with his family.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>How was life at the Government House when he was governor?</em></strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">I was 11 years old when my father became a governor. As you can imagine, I was pretty excited to be in a different environment but later had to leave soon for boarding school.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>How is life outside the Government House?</em></strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">I did not spend a lot of time at the Government House for two reasons, Firstly, I had to leave for boarding school as I said earlier and secondly, we moved out of Government House to our family home because my father didn’t want us to get used to that life.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>What was your impression about governance when your father became governor?</em></strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">I was a child when my father was a governor, and that was it.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>What do you wish to change about your father if you have the opportunity?</em></strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">He is my father and I wouldn’t change anything.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Has he ever inspired your interest in politics?</em></strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">His vision for the people and for the country is enough inspiration for anyone to want to implement change and do what is right.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Does being a child to a popular politician put a burden on you?</em></strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">A child of a popular politician? No! But as my father’s son and his first child, I have the responsibility to uphold my father’s name and image as well as set good examples for my siblings.  As I said, being the child of a popular politician has, in no way, created boundaries for me. I did not grow up as a popular politician’s son. I grew up as my father’s son. Because of the discipline I got from home, I never cultivated the habit of a lavish lifestyle. There is nothing I cannot do because of my background. There are things I chose not to do because with the disciplined I received, I knew better.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Does he have a nickname?</em></strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The people call him “maikarfi” which is a Hausa word for “the strong one.”</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Would you encourage him to contest presidency? </em></strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">One thing I know very well is that should he become the president of this country, he will take it upon his administration to become an inexorable force for a better Nigeria. He will inspire the citizens of Nigeria to work together towards a common lofty goal of non-dependence on oil. He believes that if we can find it within ourselves to embark on such an audacious and unconventional enterprise, we will surely be on course to create a perfect union. He would focus on the central issue that will carry this country into the future for instance, education. Education comes with endless opportunities in all aspects. Throughout the world, education has brought hopes to people.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">I also know that he has the blueprint of getting us out of the epileptic power supply through a renewable source of energy and a health care system that works for everyone. As someone known to be a peaceful and detribalised Nigerian, he will oversee the restructuring of Nigeria that works for everybody. I believe my father will bring about this change with the right and interests of the people in mind. Nevertheless, I will support his decision of either contesting the presidency or not.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>What were your fears during the PDP leadership crisis with Senator Ali Modu Sheriff?</em></strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">My fears were not really about losing the battle in court but more about the survival of the party. The All Progressives Congress needs the PDP to play its opposition role effectively so as to deepen and lay a foundation for a virile democratic system. That was what my father fought and stood for and I supported him all the way.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Is he a fan of any football club? </em></strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">I believe he supports our local club called Ranchers Bees FC. But of course, he likes watching foreign clubs as well, mostly Arsenal or Barcelona I believe.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>What relationship advice did he give his children?</em></strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The only advice we got was in the area of choosing who to spend the rest of our lives with. Like every dad, he told us to choose loving, compassionate, patient, supportive, reliable and smart women. But then of course, he sent me a funny joke strictly for the men on wives (Laughs).</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Copyright PUNCH.<br />\n</strong>All rights reserved.

What is your take on this?</em></strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">What is happening in Nigeria with regard to herdsmen killings shouldn’t be there if we had been strongly disposed to what is right. There is no way a business run by some people can be used to threaten the existence of other people. The business of cattle rearing has been there from medieval times. Nigeria has always been known to have certain agricultural practices domiciled in specific parts of the country. There is palm produce in the defunct Eastern region; the Western region was famous for cocoa production, while the Northern economy hinged on cattle, groundnut and cotton. People should be confined to their areas of comparative advantage where they can do well. If government had been proactive in its industrial policies, meat processing factories should have sprung up long ago in northern Nigeria, while ranches would have been built there. People now take off from Zamfara to Calabar with their cattle, leaving behind mayhem, loss of lives and property. This is a business that cannot be allowed to continue. So, if you ask me I will say that it should be restricted to the North.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>The APC recently set up a committee to see how best Nigeria will be governed. Does this tally with the expectation of the 2014 confab report?</em></strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">I believe that the recent statement by the All Progressives Congress for a gradual restructuring of the country is paying lip service to the problems of the country because the APC is not Nigeria. It is a political party and only Nigerians can find a solution to their problems. The way Nigeria will be arranged structurally will not be left in the hands of a political party. It should be left in the hands of the people and that was what the national conference of 2014 addressed. The 600 resolutions produced in that conference are critical to the survival of this country. That report should be brought forward and given effect. The APC boycotted the conference and they should apologise to Nigeria for that.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The South-East people of Nigeria are badly treated in the area of state and local government creation. The region has five states and 95 local government areas; the South-South has six states and 123 LGAs; the South-West has six states and 137 LGAs; the North-West has seven states with Jigawa and Kano states alone having about the same number of LGAs as the South-East. When you make dialogue impossible in the affairs of men, you continue to experience revolt and all these agitations in the South are fallout of cries of marginalisation and neglect; it cannot continue without being addressed. The ‘fire brigade’ approach does not solve any problem. The Fulani herdsmen went to Benue State and killed 73 people in one fell swoop and they were given a mass burial and the only thing government did was to order the Inspector-General of Police to go there and find out what was happening, instead of giving an order that herdsmen should be restricted to their states of origin.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>The late former Vice-President Alex Ekwueme was buried recently. What would you want him to be remembered for?</em></strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The greatest thing Nigeria can do for Ekwueme is to go to his intellectual contributions towards national discourse. Ekwueme desired a Nigeria that every Nigerian would love. He belonged to everybody. He desired a Nigeria where citizens have equal rights; where citizens of Nigeria can aspire to become president, irrespective of the geopolitical zone or tribe he or she comes from because of his personal experience. He devoted much of his time to researching on power sharing. That is why he proposed six geopolitical zones and rotational presidency between the North and South. These are the intellectual contributions he made towards the nation’s development and politics.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>You were recently sworn in as a senator after about three years of legal battle. How do you feel about your victory?</em></strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">It is regrettable that the legal battle to sort out the representation of the Anambra Central seat took about three years to resolve. The regret in it is that the matters that caused the delay were frivolous suits which the courts dabbled into, and delivered wrong judgments that made the struggle protracted. I believe the judiciary needs to be reformed so that judges who wilfully deliver wrong judgments on matters that come before them are punished.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Copyright PUNCH.</em><br />\n</strong>All rights reserved.

How is the politics shaping up for 2019?</em></strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The contest for the governorship in Oyo State is essentially between two parties – the Peoples Democratic Party and the All Progressives Congress. The PDP comprises the old PDP, that is,  members of the PDP as it were, and substantial members of the Labour Party, the Social Democratic Party, the Alliance for Democracy and nearly all the members of my old party, the Accord Party, who were dissolved into the new PDP. To that extent, I believe the PDP has been able to put together a very strong, virile party that has a strong base from the ward to the local government levels in the state. I believe that going by the quality and quantity of people there, I have no doubt whatsoever that come 2019, the rebranded PDP will win the governorship of Oyo State.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>So, what role will you be playing in the Oyo State politics in 2019?</em></strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">I intend to contest the primary election for the position of governor. I believe that I have the educational qualification, the capacity, the experience, the track record, and the passion for the job. Going by what I have seen, I believe the people are not getting what they deserve. First of all, the structure of the system is skewed against the progress of our people. There is a fundamental flaw in the constitution we operate, but that is a Nigerian thing.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>What is your party doing to regain power in the South-West?</em></strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The PDP is aware of the fact that for it to retain or regain power, it must be a mass movement; it must have the support of the people at the grass roots. And that is what the PDP has done. It has rebranded. It has, nationally and at the state level, gone through the crucible and it has been hit left and right and is now rebranded. That was why it went through all the political processes: it had its ward congress, local government congress and its state congress. Even at the national level, it had its national convention. Although it’s not been easy, because where two or three are gathered in search of offices or power, there is always a lot of disagreement; we agree to differ. At the end of the day, there has been a kind of agreement that we must all work together in order to reposition Oyo State and Nigeria in general. The APC, on the other hand, has been in power (in Oyo State) for nearly seven years. It has not had a single congress whether at the ward level, local government level, state level or even the national level. It is just a special vehicle that was used for a special purpose and, at the end of the day, when the purpose was achieved, they did not do anything again. The purpose of the APC, the reason why it was put together, was to get power. It never thought of what to do. They were so much in a hurry. They were so much enamoured with the need to get power at all costs. They had all manner of people of different ideologies who came together for the purpose of acquisition of power, and once that power was put in their hands, they were at a loss on what to do with it.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>How do you think the Coalition for Nigeria Movement will affect the governorship election in Oyo State?</em></strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The CNM is not going to affect anything at all. First, the people, who are supposed to be members of that movement, are already in different parties and a lot of them believe that they can actualise their political ambitions in their present parties. To now leave and join a movement, not a party, mind you, which has not been registered and will have a lot of people in there from different parties, is not going to be easy to merge them to form a united, workable movement because the time is not there. If they want to register to form a party, before they meet all the criteria, put all the structures in place and get to understand one another, it won’t work. Even parties that have been long in existence are still reconciling here and there. It’s a good thing that Chief (Olusegun) Obasanjo came out the way he did, but Nigerians are already aware of everything he said.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Calls for restructuring seem to be louder than ever. What do you think about the push for devolution of power?</em></strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Why should the Federal Government control the police when it is right there in Abuja and it doesn’t know what is happening in my local government or my ward? All over the world, where there is peace, tranquillity and justice, policing is done from the local government upwards. But here, it is from the top and so, we are not getting it. What is the business of the government with minimum wage when there is inequality in the cost of living? Even the minimum wage that is being asked to be paid is not being paid. But essentially, this issue of the Federal Government appropriating all the resources and giving handouts has totally made state governments to become beggars. Nobody is innovative anymore. At the end of the month, everybody goes with his bowl to get his or her dues, unlike before when we used to have strong regions, which controlled, to a large extent, the things that existed in those states and made the maximum use of them. So, we must go back (to that structure). It’s just simple commonsense. Our developmental trajectory from the time we had self-rule can be put into two compartments: pre-military rule and post-military rule. A lot of our development was during the civilian era of the pre-military rule and the military rule is akin to the presidential system because it’s unitary — everybody awaits orders from above and everybody goes lazy. That was how we find ourselves where we are now.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Copyright PUNCH.</em><br />\n</strong>All rights reserved.

He tells <strong>LEKE BAIYEWU</strong> about his life as a university lecturer in the United States and as a lawmaker at the National Assembly</em></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>How long have you been a member of the National Assembly?</em></strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">I came into the National Assembly in 2003 as a member of the House of Representatives. Thereafter, I contested the 2007 general election which I believed was rigged in favour of my opponent. But I thank God that four years later, in 2011, I won by a landslide and came back to the National Assembly – this time to the Senate. I won again in 2015. I am now in the Senate by the grace of God as the Chief Chip, also known as the Majority Whip.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>What duties come with being the Chief or Majority Whip?</em></strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The duty of the Chief Whip is to maintain discipline within the chamber. The Chief Whip in Nigeria doubles as the Majority Whip. That means it is my responsibility to keep my party (caucus) together on matters of party interest within the legislature and to be sure that the wishes of my party prevail. For example, if there are issues that are dear to our President – issues that he would like to be pushed through in the legislature, it is my duty to help him win on such issues?</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>How easy is the task?</em></strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">It has been a tough battle in that regard, unfortunately. From the very beginning, our party had a serious problem in the elections that produced the presiding officers – that is President of the Senate and Deputy President of the Senate. There were two camps but eventually, one camp prevailed. But the contestation produced some bad blood, not only between members of the Senate but members of the party in the Senate as well as members of the Executive and the Legislature; to the extent that certain actions by the government were overwhelmingly perceived in the Senate as persecution of this arm of government. We thank God that lately, we are beginning to see an end to that but whether we do or not, we have less than two years left in office. And I hope that the lessons that we have learnt from the extremely factional fractures in the last over two years will never again repeat itself in the near future.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>You are usually the first voice to be heard from the chamber whenever there is plenary, calling each of the senators to settle down for the day’s business. Are you satisfied with the level of decorum by your colleagues?</em></strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">No, I cannot be. You are talking to a man who, for many years, lived his life in the academia. I was a university teacher and when you are in a classroom, you are used to maintaining decorum. Throughout my years in the United States of America, my students knew that I gripped my classroom with a commanding presence and maintained a certain level of discipline. Unfortunately, if you are a governor, you are in charge of your cabinet. When you walk in, everybody stands up and they respect your wishes, and you can dismiss any one of them who does not behave himself or herself according to your wishes. But that is not the case in the Legislature. Yes, the Senate President has avenues to exercise discipline but primarily, he is a first among equals. He cannot dismiss any of us.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Right now, we can only suspend people but I actually pray that in the future, we can get rid of that rule. I don’t believe in it; I don’t believe that people should be suspended unless they are bringing outright chaos to the chamber; unless their presence will bring anarchy into the chamber. I think people should not be suspended.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Does it mean you are not satisfied with the suspension of the former Majority Leader, Senator Ali Ndume, by the Senate?</em></strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">I am not going to comment on that. I am part of the leadership and I played my role. Someday, I will write about my role but the issue I am talking about now is the principle of it generally. If I misbehave now and you send me out, you may say the lesson is that it will teach Osun people not to send a man who will misbehave to the National Assembly. But what if there is a conspiracy against me? What if there is a court (or panel) that decides to try me unfairly and send me out? At the end of the day, the process (leading to suspension of a member) is also political. And in the corridors of politics and power, things are not always what they seem.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>With your experiences in the USA and Nigeria, what are the major differences you have seen in terms of politics and lawmaking?</em></strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">In the USA to start with, most people who end up in the Senate are well-settled men and women. I am not saying that they are all wealthy but many of them are wealthy – many of the USA senators are former governors and extremely wealthy. Those who complain that former governors are now in the Senate don’t know what they are talking about. Really, in the USA, a senator is senior to a governor. It is like you are bringing the experience that you have had in your state in terms of governance to the national level. So, you will have the best of minds putting their service for the nation. But there, unfortunately, sometimes it is the reverse. The Senate is perceived by some people as a stepping stone to becoming a governor. We have seen examples of that. A few of the current governors used to be senators.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">One of the things you will find out in the USA –people don’t realise this – is that to a large extent, it is a government on cruise control. What I mean by that is that every four years, they go through their presidential election but that election is just to determine how to spend less than 20 per cent of the Federal Government’s budget. The 80 per cent is already determined and there is nothing anybody can do about it. You can tinker with it a little here and there but most of the government of the USA is fixed. No matter who comes in (as president), you are not likely to do too much damage to the social security. It is about the institutions. But here, the government is into everything and the result is that everything almost becomes a survivalist battle.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>From being a scholar in the USA to becoming a politician in Nigeria, did you experience any culture shock?</em></strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Yes, I did. I experienced culture shock in the sense that I was away for a long time. I must also be honest that much of what I experience is expected, and I have made up my mind on how to tackle them. When I was a local government chairman, usually I got to work at 7am and by 8am, I was at the gate to take a roll of latecomers. Eventually, everybody knew they had to come to work on time. Here in the Senate, when we used to sign the register – before I became a principal officer, there were three or four of us who were usually the earliest to come: the late David Kuta from Niger State, Senator (Babajide) Omoworare from my state, myself and one other. Even now, it is rare for me not to get to work at 7.30am. Part of it is that I don’t like traffic. All my life, I go to bed early and wake up early; usually by 4am I am up and my breakfast is over by 5am and I leave for work. It allows me to do some reading.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">You talked earlier about my strenuous efforts to bring decorum to the Senate. The truth is that most parliaments are not the most decorous of people. The reason is that you are co-equals. But for me, I would want a parliament that says the Senate is supposed to start at 10 o’clock and at exactly 10 o’clock, we start.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Which of the motions or bills sponsored by you is your favourite?</em></strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">One of the greatest joys of my life is that I was the one who brought the constitution amendment on reducing the age of participating in politics by our young people. As you know, currently, you cannot be a senator in Nigeria until the age of 40 and you cannot be a member of the House of Representatives until about 35. I brought the bill to reduce the requirement for membership of the House of Representatives to 25, and to reduce the membership of the Senate to 30 or 35. I argued that if you are old enough to become an officer in your country, commanding a sizeable portion of the military; or if you are old enough to be a medical doctor and have life of others at your disposal, then you have the maturity to be able to represent your people in the parliament. I also argued that the parliament is not where one person takes the decision. If you have a bad idea, there is enough presence in the parliament to correct you and you will learn from it.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Copyright PUNCH.</em><br />\n</strong>All rights reserved.

I felt it was only proper that we develop a medium through which we promote our local customs and traditions. I was not really impressed with what had been done to promote our culture and I felt that more could be done and in a better way. I felt there was a need to add colour to how our culture was being portrayed to the rest of the world. I did not want to be part of those who just sit and complain; I had to make an input and that was how Sisi Oge was born. People often ask why I choose to do an indigenous pageant, and I always tell them that the essence of pageantry goes beyond showing off beautiful looks.  I made a decision to introduce a pageant that would do all of these and more. With the Sisi Oge brand, we have been able to raise cultural ambassadors as well as export our culture. I thank God that despite the challenges we have encountered over the years, My Heritage My Pride and Sisi Oge is now in its 11th year and we are breaking more frontiers and creating structures. I am particularly pleased at the way it has impacted the youth.  The pageant has empowered several young ladies, because whenever they participate in the pageant, they are taught many life skills. I am glad that I am able to and will continue to contribute my quota to society because transformation is a journey not a destination. I haven’t gotten to where I am going yet; I am still moving.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Sisi Oge has produced several queens from different tribes in Nigeria. Why are you yet to host an edition of the pageant in a state other than Lagos? </em></strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">This brings us to the question as to why many projects in Nigeria fail. This is a brand that has a vision and direction. The most important thing to us is not the location or the venue but rather what we are promoting and why we are doing it. We have gotten invites from different states but what is paramount to us is not moving outside Lagos but rather to continue in this upright direction and above all, Lagos State has been helpful in sustaining this laudable initiative.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Why do you think youths are afraid to speak out against issues affecting them?  </em></strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The coming together with one voice is one of the major challenges that the youth face today. Instead of coming together to address a common problem, the youth of nowadays would rather address individual issues. We need to understand that generational shift does not happen in one year and until Nigerian youths understand that we must suspend our personal interest, we might not be able to fight for what is duly ours.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Why do youths prioritise money? </em></strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">That is what the leaders have sold to them. If you replace the current crop of  elected politicians with youths, the latter won’t do any better because they have been sold a wrong ideology. I am propelled by my love for the arts and culture. To do all that I do, I have created several businesses, such that even if I don’t get support from outside, my businesses will help me to achieve my goals.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>You seem to be very passionate about rewriting the story of Nigerian youths. Aside from being a youth, what else drives this passion?  </em></strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">I understand that in life, you need to contribute and add value to whatever you meet on the ground. Let people know why you are here, why you came and why they need you.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Aside from Sisi Oge, in what other ways are you adding value to society?  </em></strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">I am not just a pageant organiser; I promote several other things that depict the authentic African culture. I am also the convener of ‘Our Lagos Your Lagos’.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>What is the vision of ‘Our Lagos Your Lagos’? </em></strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">We are saying that Lagos belongs to everybody and we must continue to build Lagos together. Some of the ways by which we are spreading the word is through a project for children called ‘Connecting Smiles’. At the end of every year, we also organise a music and message concert. We noticed that Nigerians are getting tired of seminars; so, we decided to seek other avenues to sell the vision to them in a relaxed atmosphere. We believe that for the love of Lagos, we all have a part to play in making Lagos work.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Why is your focus Lagos and not Nigeria? </em></strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Lagos is the commercial nerve centre of Africa. Lagos is the home to all. Lagos is a city that accommodates all.  Lagos is me and I am also Lagos. I believe so much in the city that has given me so much today and I also owe my state my best contribution. I am also urging every Lagosian to stand out and give their best contribution to the state that gives them reason to excel.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>The youth have been accused of not seeking elective positions. Is that the case or is it that the present crop of leaders is not giving the youth a chance? </em></strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">I disagree with that notion because a lot of things need to be corrected among the youth. If we think that our leaders are bad, a lot of youths are not better.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>What solution can you proffer to this issue? </em></strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">We must get things right. We need to understand that as youths, we must be able to encourage dialogue. We must present ourselves in the best manner possible.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Why haven’t you indicated interest in any political office? </em></strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Being a political office holder will come at the right time.  A political office holder is supposed to grow society and this is what I do every day of my life. Some of my political mentors include Asiwaju BolaTinubu and Governor Akinwunmi Ambode.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>What is your take on the ‘Not Too Young To Run’ bill?  </em></strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">It is a very good one, but are youths ready to take charge? Do we have credible youths who can bring about the change we all desire? The concept is a fantastic one but the problem is that the youth of today are quite corrupt and not prepared to take charge.  This can be blamed on the bad leadership they have experienced over the years.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>What do you think the government can do to change the narrative of youths in Nigeria? </em></strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">We don’t have to wait for the government to change our narrative. We have to start working on that by ourselves. Youths need to see themselves as leaders of tomorrow and not just because everybody is saying it. We need to understand political offices are not about show-off but about true service to the people We need to be able define our purpose. Before we aspire to be governors, senate president and other high offices, we need to be prepared. Nigerians don’t like to prepare and that is why we have a lot of half-baked professionals in the country.  We should understand that what worked for Mr. A might not work for Mr. B.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">While growing up, we were made to understand that heaven helps those who help themselves. If heaven will only help those who help themselves, is it our leaders that will help those who don’t help themselves? We should stop being crazy about money and fame. Instead, we should place more emphasis on the value that a person can bring.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Copyright PUNCH.</em><br />\n</strong>All rights reserved.

We have done the one for Abuja already.  We will subsequently launch campaigns in the 36 states of the federation.”</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">On why most of the personalities in the organisation are from southern Nigeria, Osuntokun said, “That is not correct. Ahmadu Ali is the protem chairman to begin with. Don’t forget that the coalition has just been launched and there will be more developments as time goes on.”</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">When asked why the coalition was accepting old politicians despite preaching a shift of power to the youth, Osuntokun said there was a need to blend the old and the new.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">He said, “For any organisation to survive, no matter your ambition, it has to be a blend of the old and the new. The coalition will be depriving itself of a source of strength if you rule out completely the enlistment of significant political actors who have been on the stage for a while.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">“Also, not all of them are tainted. There are quite a number of them that have their integrity intact. In politics, you don’t drive people away as long as they subscribe to the ideology of your organisation.”</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The former Managing Director of the <em>News Agency of Nigeria</em> said all persons were welcome in the party.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">When asked if the National Leader of the All progressives Congress, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, would be welcome into the coalition, he said, “If Tinubu says he is joining, that will be a big boost to the organisation because he is a big fish. He has immense political value in terms of followership and boots on the ground.”</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">He refused to mention the names of the 13 governors said to be planning to join the coalition, saying it wouldn’t be strategic for him to do so.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Reacting to whether the collation would merge with the APC or the Peoples Democratic Party ahead of the 2019 elections, Oshuntokun said both political parties had lost the confidence of Nigerians and it was unlikely that the coalition would endorse either of the two.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Osuntokun, however, stated that it was possible for the coalition to register as a political party and contest independently.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Asked if a former Governor of Osun State, Prince Olagunsoye Oyinlola, would resign as Chairman of the National Identity Management Commission in order to prove his loyalty to the coalition, Osuntokun said there was no need for him to do so.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">He added that President Muhammadu Buhari was free to sack him but there was no need for Oyinlola to resign since the appointment was not the exclusive preserve of APC members.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Osuntokun added, “He is a Nigerian citizen and that is all a person needs to be given a public appointment. If I were in his position, I would leave it to the President to decide.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">“There is no law that says it is only members of the President’s party who should be appointed to public office. Until the President decides otherwise, he can remain there and if I were him, I would not resign because I have done nothing wrong.”</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Copyright PUNCH.</em><br />\n</strong>All rights reserved.

Every party fights and how you resolve it is what is important.’’</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Shortly after Usani’s suspension, a faction of the party led by the state Organising Secretary, Mr. Ekpe Ayang, held a meeting, where they declared the minister’s suspension as null and void.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">They went ahead to announce the suspension of Ochala and Eta from the party.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Subsequently, the Ayang-led group went ahead to endorse Etim John as the new acting chairman of the party in the state.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">However, a statement from the National Publicity Secretary of the APC, Bolaji Abdullahi, on Friday, faulted John’s emergence as the party chairman in the state, saying Ochala remained the acting chairman.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The statement also noted that members involved in the appointment of a new acting chairman would be disciplined.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">However, John, who has gone ahead with the backing of the minister to take over the party secretariat, said the statement from the national leadership of the party was a misnomer.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">He said, “Ochala is not from the zone where the former chairman comes from and so he was not qualified to be an acting state chairman, but because a vacuum cannot be left, he, as a deputy chairman, took over.’’</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Ochala took over as the party’s acting chairman after Usani, who was the then chairman, was appointed a minister.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Meanwhile, Senate President, Dr. Bukola Saraki, has called on members of the All Progressives Congress in Rivers State to reconcile their differences and unite ahead of the 2019 general elections.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The Senate President spoke on Saturday in Port Harcourt during a thanksgiving organised in honour of the lawmaker representing Rivers South-East, Senator Magnus Abe.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">This is just as the state Governor, Nyesom Wike, made a surprise appearance at the Polo Club in Port Harcourt, venue of the reception for the event that brought over 30 federal lawmakers to the  state.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">However, the leader of the APC in the state and Minister of Transportation, Mr. Rotimi Amaechi, was absent as he was said to be  holding a rally in Ogoniland.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Saraki said Abe worked hard for the party during and after elections, adding that some of those in the cabinet of the current administration would not have been there if not for Abe.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">In his remarks, Wike explained that power would always come from God.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">He recalled how he tried to stop Abe from winning the senatorial seat for Rivers South East, but failed in his bid, adding that those in the APC also tried their best to stop him from becoming the governor of the state to no avail.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Speaking on Amaechi’s absence at the event, Abe said he invited the minister, adding that he (Amaechi) did not honour his invitation, but decided to hold a rally in Bori, Khana Local Government Area of the state.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Copyright PUNCH.</em><br />\n</strong>All rights reserved.

Also, only two INEC staff members were assigned to conduct the registration in each local government area. There is also only one registration centre in each local government area.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">During a visit by one of our correspondents to the registration centre in Enugu North Local Government Area at the Prison Club Hall, Enugu, it was observed that the pace of the registration was very slow, a development which frustrated both the officials and the residents, who turned out in a large number to register.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Some of the residents said they had been to the registration centre on several occasions but had gone home without registering.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Besides inadequate staffing of the registration centres, it was also learnt that the data capturing machines were not always functional, mostly due to lack of power supply.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">At other registration centres, it was equally observed that the printers were not functional, hence, those who were able to register were unable to collect their voter cards.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"> <strong>INEC officials unavailable in some Ondo centres</strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Some residents in Ondo State also expressed dissatisfaction over the registration exercise in the state.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">At some of the registration centres visited by one of our correspondents, INEC officials were not available even though many people were waiting to register.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Some of the residents complained bitterly that they had been going to the centres but that INEC officials had not been showing up.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"> <strong>Voters stranded in A’Ibom</strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Saturday PUNCH</em> also observed as several residents were stranded at the INEC registration centres in Akwa Ibom State, with some of them complaining that even though they arrived at the centres as early as 7 am, they still couldn’t register.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">INEC Publication Relations Officer, Akwa Ibom State, Mr. John Etukudo, said the situation was so because the commission did not have enough resources to be at all the wards at the same time, hence the need to rotate the equipment at registration centres.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"> <strong>Poor electricity in Kwara</strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">In Kwara State, poor electricity had been identified as the main issue being encountered during the ongoing voter registration.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">One of our correspondents who visited some registration centres observed that while some of them had an epileptic public power supply, some had faulty generators, while some centres with functioning generators did not have petrol to run them.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Due to these challenges, frustrated residents were being asked by INEC officials to return for registration at a later date.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"> Oyo:<strong> INEC officials not always available</strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">In Oyo State, residents faced a huge task of registering because the electoral officers were not always available at the designated centres.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Some residents complained that even though they were told that their Permanent Voter Cards were ready, they were told to go and collect them elsewhere.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">A resident, Mrs. Iyabo Alagbe, said, “They showed us more than 300 voter cards, but our own were not there. They couldn’t give us any reason because it seemed they were powerless. I almost quarrelled with them when I went there last time, but an official explained to me that everything was controlled in Abuja.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">INEC spokesperson in the state, Ayodele Folami, said that the commission had been moving from ward to ward to reach the people, noting that there were more than 600,000 unclaimed Permanent Voter Cards.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Faulty machines in Lagos</strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">In Lagos State, one of our correspondents who visited the INEC registration centre at the Ketu Primary Health Centre, observed as residents complained due to the faulty printer.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">A resident, Kunle Dada, said he had hoped to collect his voter card on Thursday after registering the previous day, only to be told to come back at a later day.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Ogun:<strong> Residents not attended to</strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">It was complaints galore at the INEC registration centres in Ogun State as residents complained of long hours of delay, lack of proper coordination and breakdown of registration machines.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">For instance, at INEC’s centre situated within the premises of the Ado Odo/Ota Local Government secretariat at Ota, Ogun State, several residents who wanted to do fresh registration, inter-state transfer of voter cards and those who had lost their permanent voter cards, had issues with the process.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Some of them claimed to have been coming for days without success.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">A member of staff of the Covenant University, Ota, Dr. Olusola Oyero, who spoke with one of our correspondents on Friday said he had gone to the centre on Thursday but was asked to return on Friday.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">He said when he was at the centre on Friday by 7 am, a list had been prepared and that he was number 198 on the list. He said by 8 am, another list had surfaced and he was number 163 on it.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Expressing disappointment, he said by 10 am, one of the INEC officials announced that some of the machines had developed a fault and that only two were working.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Another resident who came to do fresh registration, Fatimah Ibrahim, said she had arrived the centre as early as 5.30 am, but as of 11 am, she was still in the queue yet to be attended to.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">But the Administrative Secretary, INEC, Ogun State, Mr. Kayode Oladimeji, said there was no cause for alarm, promising that the exercise would accommodate all those who wanted to register.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"> Edo:<strong> Faulty machines</strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">It was also gathered that the exercise in many of the registration centres in Edo State was being marred due to the faulty machines and irregular power supply.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">It was also learnt that some of the centres were overwhelmed by a large number of eligible voters who turned out for the exercise.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Some residents, Gift Clifford and Samuel Muhammed, lamented that they were directed by one of the registration officers to return on Monday, after spending more than four hours to get registered.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"> <strong>Return in May to register, INEC officials tell FCT  residents</strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Hundreds of eligible voters,  who came out on Friday to register at the LEA Primary School Kubwa 2, Abuja, were told to return on May 10, 2017, before they could be registered by INEC.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Officials of INEC also told voters, who came to request for the transfer of their permanent voter cards from where they had registered to Abuja that it could take up to six months before the cards would be delivered to their respective owners in the Federal Capital Territory.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">No reason was given as to why it would take up to six months before the voter cards would get to Abuja from where the cards were being transferred from.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">However, on why eligible voters who wish to register were to return in May after writing their names on a list on Friday, an official of the commission who pleaded not to be named, said, “Hundreds, if not thousands of people have written their names and they have not been registered.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">“What we are doing is that we follow the list and right now, many people who wrote their names on this booklet last month or two months ago are being considered and are registering now. So those coming now will have to wait till it gets to their turn to register.”</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Some of those who came to register at the Kubwa centre on Friday told <em>Saturday PUNCH</em> that the registration process was discouraging.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">A resident who only gave his name as Aminu said, “There have been so many campaigns urging people to go out and register in order to vote in 2019, but seeing what is happening here and the long procedure that it takes to just get the card is highly discouraging”</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Another resident, Mrs. Stella Odinaka, said she wrote her name on the list provided by the INEC officials early last month but had yet to be registered.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">One registration and data capturing equipment was sighted at the Kubwa centre as about 15 persons were seated behind the INEC official who was operating the machine, while over 60 people were seen struggling to either write their names on the list or get assess into the registration room.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Bribery allegation in Kubwa</strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">There were allegations of bribery and impropriety in the centre at the Model Primary School, Kubwa II, in Bwari Area Council on Friday.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Some of those who went to register complained about the fact that only one laptop computer was being used for the exercise, while close to 100  people  were waiting to be registered.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Narrating his ordeal, Mr. Franklin Ibe said he was at the venue of the exercise at 6 am but that the registration officials did not arrive until 10:30 am.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">He said, “I was waiting for my turn when one man came with four women; I don’t know what he went in to tell the people inside.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">“Suddenly, he took the women inside, that was when I started to make trouble and I brought out my phone to record, the place became rowdy.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">“One of them (registration officers) came out to take me inside before I was registered and given my temporary voter card. It was after that I heard that some people paid N500 to be registered. The officers here said the machine could only register 30 people a day.”</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Kano residents complain</strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">In Kano State, some residents lamented that they encountered challenges in their efforts to register.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">One of such eligible voters, identified as Mrs. Alice John of First Baptist Church, Sabon Gari, Kano, told <em>Saturday PUNCH</em> that she tried in vain to register.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">When   contacted, INEC spokesman in Kano, Garba Lawan, dismissed the woman’s claims, stressing that it was strange for him to learn that she   encountered any challenge.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>INEC creates more centres in Niger</strong></p>\n<p>INEC said it had not experienced any challenge in Niger State. It was   learnt that   the commission   had so far registered, 95, 434 eligible voters who were waiting for the final production and collection of their permanent voter   cards.</p>\n<p>A member of staff   of INEC in charge of operations, Martins Boris, said that in April 2017, INEC had 33 centres in Niger State before the approval of 10 additional ones.</p>\n<p><strong>Complaints  in Taraba</strong></p>\n<p>But there were complaints in Taraba State. At some of the registration centres in Jalingo   and other   towns,  residents   complained of the difficulties they faced while trying to obtain their voter cards.</p>\n<p>At the Mile Six Primary School, Jalingo,  over 400 people   were waiting to register. They   said that they had written their names on the instruction of the INEC officials, who promised to attend to them based on the time of their arrival. They said they had been waiting in vain.</p>\n<p>Mr.   Ushahemba Terkimbi said many of them had spent days coming to the Mile Six primary School, Jalingo without being registered.</p>\n<p>In Takum Local Government, Mr.   Yakubu Tikon, said only one registration machine was functional as of the time of filing this report.</p>\n<p>In Zing Local Government Area, Mr. Tavoro Sholanko, said the Direct Digital Capture machine   brought to the area had not been functioning   properly, making it difficult for people to register.</p>\n<p>Sholanko called on INEC to replace the DDC machines for effective voter registration.</p>\n<p><strong>Exercise hitch-free in Kastina</strong></p>\n<p>In Katsina State, 118,525 people have been registered so far. The figure is made up of 74,894 males and 43,631 females.</p>\n<p>The INEC Resident Electoral Commissioner for Katsina, Alhaji Jibril Zarewa, confirmed the development.</p>\n<p><strong>Report corrupt officers </strong>– INEC</p>\n<p>In his reaction, the Chief Press Secretary to the INEC Chairman, Mr. Rotimi Oyekanmi, urged members of the pubic to report any official extorting money from anyone.</p>\n<p>Oyekanmi said there were phone numbers and emails through which complaints could be lodged.</p>\n<p>He said, “We encourage Nigerians to report any INEC official extorting money. No employee should collect money and it will never be tolerated. If that allegation is found to be true, that official will be dealt with.</p>\n<p>“On our website there are about eight to 10 phone numbers through which you can report cases of extortion. Just indicate the registration centre where money is being extorted and we will handle the rest.”</p>\n<p>The INEC official said the commission had supplied new computers to some of the registration centres to ensure that the pace of registration moved faster.</p>\n<p>Oyekanmi also urged prospective voters not to be in a haste to register as the Continuous Voter Registration exercise would remain open until 60 days before election .</p>\n<p>He added, “I appeal to all Nigerians to bear with us. We are sorry for the challenges they face when they go to register. We are aware that there are hiccups in some areas due to lack of equipment. We are currently addressing these issues.”</p>\n<p>”<strong>Copyright PUNCH.</strong><strong><br />\n</strong><em>All rights reserved.

He speaks with Hindi Livinus, in this interview</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Most of the attacks in 2017 here in Adamawa between farmers and herdsmen took place in your doma</em></strong>in.<strong><em> Can you tell us more about the attacks?</em></strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">2017 was actually a year of devastation of the communities within my domain. It hasn’t been easy for the people because the attacks were so many. They started in August in Kodomun where so many people were killed.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Some Fulani entered the community and killed about 27 people and burnt down the entire village. They even waited again when the burial was being conducted for the slain and launched another attack, again slaughtering so many people. This increased the casualty in the attacks on Kodomun to 38. As if that one was not enough, there was another attack again, but this time in Kwayine which is still under my domain. This time, the Fulani people went and destroyed the farmlands of our people claiming that the Kwayine people killed their cows.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">But the police which was asked by the state government to ascertain the circumstances of the attacks in their investigations discovered that only two cows were killed whereas the Fulani claimed that 80 cows were killed. Thereafter, the state government called us to the government house to assess the amount of damage done by the Fulani to our farmlands. It was estimated that more than 30 farms were destroyed. If compensations were to be paid for the destroyed farmlands, the compensations would have amounted to about N30 million. But the government did not pay compensations to the farmers. Instead, it went ahead to compensate the Fulani for 80 cows instead of two. For each of the cows, the government paid  N100,000 compensation to the Fulani owner. We did not revenge, but instead, I asked my people to be calm, assuring them that the government would look into their grievances.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">However, shortly after compensations were made to the Fulani and the government extracted some form of assurances from the Fulani not to attack Kwayine, it did not take up to two days before they launched another attack on Kwayine, killing the seven policemen that were drafted into the area to restore peace and order.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">An administrative panel of inquiry was set up by the state government to look into the remote and immediate causes of the clashes. The panel has submitted its report but the government has yet to act on the report. So last year was very terrible for our communities. The people are still grappling with their losses. The promise made by the state government to repair the buildings destroyed in the attacks is yet to be fulfilled.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Do you see any hidden agenda behind the attacks against peasant farmers?</em></strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Obviously, we know that there’s a hidden agenda behind these attacks. The attacks are not just limited to my kingdom alone; it’s part of a grand design to wipe out the entire former areas under Numan Federation and cower us into giving them our lands to use for cattle grazing. Definitely, my people are disturbed about the killings which they have also come to see as part of an orchestrated design gradually being executed but it will not see the light of day.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Despite the level of killings and destruction that took place in your domain, were you worried that the President did not mention it while addressing the nation?</em></strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">We were not surprised about that. When the Vice President visited Numan after the Dong attacks, he came with the intention of visiting the area to see those places destroyed. But some people were trying to take him somewhere else; my twin brother, the Hama Bachama and I had to stand our ground that he had to go to Dong. So we are not surprised that no mention was made of the clashes in the  broadcast by the president. A similar scenario may have played out there also, who knows. Ordinarily one would have expected the clashes to have been mentioned in the President’s broadcast and perhaps for the president to assure the citizenry that some decisive action was being taken in addressing it.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>You claimed that the Fulani herders were compensated with N100,000 per cow, who gave this compensation?</em></strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The state government gave the compensation but it is yet to extend same to the farmers whose houses and farmlands were destroyed.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Not a single kobo has been given to any farmer since the recurring attacks on our community.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>But we learnt that the government gave the people of Kodomun N10m?</em></strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">A: When has the token financial assistance of N10m offered the people of Kodomun along with some relief materials now become compensations? What the government gave after the Kodomun attacks was just to cushion the effect of the attack at the time. The government promised to make the actual compensations after the administrative panel of inquiry submitted its report.  But it has yet to do so.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>So are you saying that government has not been fair in handling the clashes between farmers and herders?</em></strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">We have reasons to be very skeptical of the government’s handling of these conflicts. While the attacks persisted, we kept on telling the government that what was happening is a time bomb which could lead to huge destruction if not carefully tackled.  We called on the government to stand firm and resolve the issue with the seriousness it deserved.

Everybody up till now is still taking a position to back their side. No reasonable consensus has yet to be reached in resolving the conflict. However, we (traditional institutions) are not leaving any stone unturned in finding a way out of the conflict. But that notwithstanding, the government has to stop the recurrent clashes between farmers and herders.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Is it true that the identity cards of some of the attackers were discovered at the scene of the recent attacks in Dong? Did it also confirm the long held suspicion that most of the attacks are not from the local fulani but their foreign mercenaries?</em></strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Yes it is true. I saw about two or three identity cards of some of these Fulani armed men picked up at the scene of the recent attacks.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Their identity shows that they are not Nigerians, some of them are from Chad and Niger. We already knew even long before these attacks that the attackers are not the Fulani that live within our communities, that come to fight us but they employ some mercenaries to come and do that. They are usually the ones holding those sophisticated weapons. Nevertheless, the most recent attacks further brought this into light and confirmed our suspicion that foreign mercenaries were being hired to carry out these attacks. These are the mercenaries that are being paid.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Copyright PUNCH.</strong><strong><br />\n</strong><em>All rights reserved.

The two issues this reinstatement has raised for me are: first, the issue of the charge of nepotism against the Buhari-led administration and two, the charge of cover-up of corrupt officials by the administration when their cows are deemed to be sacred. The person concerned, right from the outset of the allegation that he engaged in fraud to the tune of N919m at the agency and living large by cruising in vehicles suggesting flamboyance, waste and profligacy, held public opinion in disdain. Nigerians can recall that he openly treated the Minister of Health, Prof. Isaac Adewole, who had suspended him; with contempt by saying that he was not responsible to him and was only responsible to the President who put him there.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The report of a panel that was set up had indicted him; the panel comprised officials of the ministry of health, Department of State Services and the Independent Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences Commission. Following the report, the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission took over the matter with a view to investigating him thoroughly and possibly bring charges against him. As it is, he is still facing investigations by the EFCC. So the implications of the reinstatement therefore are many.  But let us say clearly that we need to be assured at this stage that the blood of ethnicity is not thicker than the water of integrity and that we do not need to start thinking anew of a fresh pan-Nigerian solidarity to salvage Nigeria’s democracy and protect its unity because nepotism drives at the heart of national cohesion. We need that kind of reassurance because the insinuation that will be made at this point is that this person is being reinstated against all that the public knows and against the stage of the investigation against him for no other reason than ethnic affinity. And even if you are the best lover of this government, you will find it difficult to defend that allegation and explain it away. How can an administration that makes war against corruption one of the pillars of its existence do this? We are not told that the President has investigated this matter; we only know that a panel has indicted this person and he is being investigated by the EFCC. Now, this clearance has in a way predetermined the matter and prejudged it. If he has been cleared, reinstated and vindicated, in a manner of speaking, what is the EFCC going to investigate any longer? So we need to make that very clear. Two, this reinstatement is against extant public service rules. I’m talking about the Public Service Rules of 2000. These rules are applicable to all public officers, including political office holders. There is a provision that talks about interdiction and suspension of public officers and I’m referring to the provision of Rule 04403, which covers interdiction and 04405, which governs suspension. These provisions empower the permanent secretary, head of extra ministerial departments and the Federal Civil Service Commission to suspend public officers of misconduct until the matter is resolved or at least to interdict them and put them on half salary until the matter is resolved one way or another. If that officer is then exonerated after criminal investigation and prosecution, he then has a duty to inform those authorities that I have just mentioned that he has been exonerated and then he will be reinstated. This procedure has not been followed in this case; all that we have is the Presidency using his executive power to reinstate this officer without following the due process of law. This must leave every patriotic Nigerian worried because this officer was allegedly involved in serious administrative and financial infraction under the Public Procurement Act 2007, which provides in section 58 for offences covering all sorts of things. So the law is there, the big questions that Nigerians have been asking are: What is this for? Can a government be this disdainful of public opinion? Is this what democracy is about?</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Should the minister resign?</em></strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Look, politicians do not resign in Nigeria whether they are academics or businessmen who find their way there. It is like politics is devoid of integrity, morality and good conscience, it ought not to be so but politics has become business or robbery. Nobody wants to leave a position in government. They say, “You cannot leave the government. Do you know how we suffered to get to this point?” They will find all sorts of excuses to cling to power. So I won’t offer any advice; I don’t want to give any advice to the minister. I’m not God; but I can say that if he values his integrity, responsibility, his capacity to continue to discharge his responsibility as a minister, he should leave because once you lose faith and once a subordinate has been used as a whip to whip you into line and put you in your place, your capacity to discharge your responsibility is eroded, your authority is undermined and your confidence is obliterated. So if you know what dignity in office is all about, you just go away. But I would be shocked if that fellow is going to leave the government. Government for them is the beginning and the end of everything.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>What does this portray about this government’s anti-corruption war?</em></strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">It is a sad day for the anti-corruption war in Nigeria. Some people have said that this war doesn’t exist. But people like us believe that it does exist and we need to encourage it. The anti-corruption war is not a war that the elite, politicians and those in power want to fight. It is a war that people in Nigeria want to make them fight. So if you share that perspective, you will understand that no matter how fledgling it is, it is our responsibility as citizens to encourage that the war should go on. So that is the attitude that we have adopted but with something like this, our confidence is shaking and our optimism is waning. I cannot find any good reason for this reinstatement and the administration has not offered any. All that Abba Kyari (Chief of Staff to the President) has said (in the letter) is to ask the man to go and cooperate with the minister and that they should learn how to work together, whatever that means.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>There was no mention of the probe report by the panel and ongoing investigation by the EFCC of the allegations against Yusuf. Did Buhari’s action rubbish the report of the panel and EFCC’s investigation?</em></strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">There is something called body language and the projection of power is not by issuance of directives alone. Power may be projected by silence; it may be projected by other means. So if you are an anti-corruption agency and you are grilling someone over an allegation of graft for which he has been suspended and the person who appointed you or the authority that wields executive powers at the federal level issues a letter reinstating that person and says go and learn how to work with the minister, while maintaining silence on the allegations, what will be your deduction? Do you imagine that such an agency, no matter how brave or reckless it is, will pursue that investigation with the level of zeal it had used to pursue it? Come on!</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">This is reality; that which is not stated has been implied. For me, the letter is saying stop doing what you are doing, “this is the disposition of the President, let this matter be quietly sorted out, this is our beloved public officer in whom we are well pleased, listen to him.”</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">I expect that from this moment, all the authorities will be winding up whatever they are doing about the allegations against this person because clearly, this is what I would call a presidential veto.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Does the President have that right of veto or power to usurp the investigation being carried out by an anti-corruption agency like the EFCC?</em></strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">My view is that this is not about whether the President has powers to do that or not, but of course, the power is not there. Indeed it is an offence for you to interfere in a criminal investigation and subvert the course of justice; it is a criminal offence. So it is clear that the power is not there but this kind of thing has become common. It did not only happen under this administration, but also under the previous administration.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Some of our compatriots didn’t want to give this administration a chance but they were a bellicose minority and there were people who were just angry with the outcome of the election. But there were also people –patriots – who love this country, who despite the imperfection of man, felt that this administration should be given all the support it needed. And it is important that we stress that to promote national cohesion, the northern part of the country had to produce the President, and so they supported this administration. They were not members of any party and were enamoured of the touted integrity and credibility and all that. For such people, this kind of action would make their hearts sink. These are not things that they expected to be seeing right now so there is no justification for it. For the record, this Presidency has not provided any justification.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>After his suspension, Yusuf had said the minister lacked the power to suspend him and even at a time when he was called on the telephone by The PUNCH, he had said, “F*ck you, and f*ck the minister.” Now that he has been asked to work with the minister, do you think he will have any respect for the minister as his boss?</em></strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">It is obvious, by this letter, Prof. Yusuf, technically speaking, has become the boss of that ministry and the minister has become his subordinate. So, the f*ck you, f*ck the minister thing is going to be given life now. Even if the minister were to remain in that ministry, I think that for the time that he would be there, he would stay aloof. Nothing from that agency (NHIS) will make the minister to do anything anymore. As far as they are concerned, the NHIS has become a separate entity that is no longer under the ministry of health. It has become an island of authority that is tied to the Presidency directly, so it is not under the ministry of health. This may then also mean that eventually if the administration is going to reshuffle cabinet as it promised to do, this minister is going to be out.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>There is a similar case in the ministry of finance involving the minister, Kemi Adeosun and the Director-General of the Securities and Exchange Commission, Mounir Gwarzo. Looking at this incident, what do you think will play out there?</em></strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">I’m not a soothsayer but I think that if I were Gwarzo, I would hire Yusuf as my consultant. I would say Prof. Yusuf, how did you do it? What role did you play that gave you this fantastic landing, not even a soft landing? Give me the opportunity to also be similarly treated as you have. It may not sound farfetched that we could have that kind of thing. It is sad. There are actions you take in government that may add to or affect your integrity. But this Prof. Yusuf’s incident is really devastating to those who love this administration and I think people will have to commiserate with themselves over this. There is no way you can put it – this is very-very ugly more so when the man in question has boasted publicly in this country that, “I don’t answer to you, Mr. Minister, I answer only to the President who put me here.” The president should have been guided and paid attention to public opinion.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Do you see tribalism and double standard in the reinstatement of Yusuf?</em></strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">At the outset, I said that there is a charge of nepotism, this charge recently was given prominence by former President Olusegun Obasanjo’s letter and people have been saying it. When you talk about nepotism, it includes tribalism, double standard and others. That is what nepotism means. And nepotism may not just be on the basis of ethnic affinity or allegiance of loyalty, it may even be on the basis of social or political association. Nepotism encompasses all that have to do with double standard, not putting the right people in the right places and favoritism. Nepotism also leads to impunity, and sometimes impunity leads to nepotism. It is a charge and it is left for the government to convince Nigerians that there is no nepotism here.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">  <strong>Copyright PUNCH.</strong><strong><br />\n</strong><em>All rights reserved.

political party.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">It said that the Presidency was more concerned on how to return an obviously unpopular presidential candidate in 2019.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">It said that the appointment of a former governor of Lagos State, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, as the leader of the <a href="http://punchng.com/buhari-asks-tinubu-to-reconcile-aggrieved-apc-members-2/"><span style="color: #0000ff;">All Progressives Congress Reconciliation Committee by</span></a> the Presidency was wrong.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">It added that Tinubu, who is also the national leader of the  ruling party, could not deliver an unpopular presidential candidate in 2019.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The party said the Presidency had become so panicky that it had effectively hijacked the functions of the leadership of its alleged “dysfunctional and ideologically-vacuous All Progressives Congress,” by appointing people into partisan offices, outside the much-desired responsibility of governance.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The PDP National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan, in a statement in Abuja on Thursday, said, “It is ludicrous that after almost three years of failure to deliver on its campaign promises, the Buhari Presidency is now moving around, cap in hand, looking for those to use once again to beguile Nigerians ahead of the 2019 elections.”</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Ologbondiyan said that the Buhari Presidency had failed to be remorseful for its alleged misrule, noting that the disagreements in his  (Buhari’s) party were fallouts of members’ resentment towards his desperation for power.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">He said, “There is widespread disenchantment and indignation across the nation resulting from hunger and the inability of the Buhari Presidency to provide the people with basic necessities of life, which they had always enjoyed in the past.</p>\n<p><strong>READ ALSO:</strong> <a

style="text-align: justify;">“Nigerians are therefore waiting to see how Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, who has also openly expressed his concerns and disapprovals on the mismanagement of the economy and whose large constituents are direct victims of the ineptitude, impunity, nepotism, dictatorial tendencies, corruption and insecurity that have characterised the Buhari Presidency, will now turn around to preach that all is well and attempt to sell a practically bad product to the nation.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">“It is instructive to further state that the desperate move by the Presidency to politically prey on individuals is mere foolhardiness and a totally decadent approach to pit key leaders against the people on an issue that has already been thrown overboard.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">“This is more so as the political institutions and front runners that threw up the Buhari Presidency in 2015 have now, not only regretted their actions, but have also strongly advised that President Buhari should not contemplate contesting a second term in office.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">“Nigerians today suffer from pains inflicted on them by this administration and no amount of manipulation of individuals and public institutions can make them change their resolve to vote out the APC in 2019, particularly as the party is stuck with an unpopular candidate.”</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Ologbondiyan added that the PDP found  the APC’s attempt to reconcile its dwindling ranks as laughable, cosmetic and politically inconsequential.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">“It will interest the APC to know that Nigerians are already rallying with the repositioned and rebranded PDP as we are poised to present a credible, competent and reliable candidate through a free, fair and transparent presidential primary,” he added.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Responding, the APC asked the PDP to steer clear of its internal affairs.</p>\n<p><strong>YOU MAY ALSO LIKE &#8211;</strong> <a href="http://punchng.com/buhari-tinubu-oshiomhole-falana-attack-obasanjo/"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Buhari: Tinubu, Oshiomhole, Falana attack Obasanjo</span></a></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The National Publicity Secretary of the APC, Mallam Bolaji Abdullahi, said, “Why are they worried about the internal affairs of our party? If the spokesman for the PDP has nothing to say he should shut up, what’s their business with our reconciliation?</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">“Why are they concerned that we may not be able to achieve reconciliation? They should leave us alone. They should mind their business; we are ready to take them on issues of governance and policy that should be the focus of opposition not our internal affairs.”</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Copyright PUNCH.<br />\n</strong>All rights reserved.

He therefore called on the EFCC to assist INEC in curbing corruption.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Yakubu said, “The Electoral Act places limits on the amount that each individual can spend in an election and also the amount that friends of candidates and parties can contribute in the election.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">“We want the EFCC which has the mandate and capacity to track and trace sources of funds to work closely with us so that we can trace within the limits of the law. Our democracy should never be on sale and I believe by working closely with the EFCC, we can achieve that.”</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The INEC chairman said the anti-graft agency should also help the electoral body to tackle the issue of bribing voters at polling units.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">He said, “As we approach the 2019 general elections, we will require your support essentially in two ways. Number one, INEC is worried by the recent trend of vote buying at open polling stations. Candidates and parties go to polling stations with sacks of money to induce voters.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">“Only the votes of citizens should determine who wins an election. Our democracy must never be for sale on the open market. It is the will of the people that should determine who wins.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">“Open vote buying will not be tolerated by the commission and we don’t want the 2019 general election to be determined by the amount of money that people have.”</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Yakubu thanked the EFCC for helping the commission to expose corrupt officials, many of whom, he said, were facing prosecution in several courts.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The INEC boss said over 200 officials had been sacked or suspended for alleged corrupt practices. He, however, maintained that most INEC officials were hard-working and honest.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">He said at least 85 officials died due to stress last year, adding that their work for the commission must be appreciated.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Yakubu added, “We interdicted a total of 205 officials. I also wish to say that among the staff of the commission are some of the conscientious and most hard-working Nigerians and it is for that reason that last year, the commission promoted 7,330 staff members.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">“I also wish to say that we are one of the agencies in the country working under extreme pressure with time limits. Everything we do has a time limit under the law. In January, we conducted elections in three states and we have another one in Katsina this Saturday and thereafter, we have another one in Taraba.”</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">“As a result of the tremendous pressure on the staff, it may interest you to know that we lost 85 employees of INEC, many of them were as a result of stress-related illnesses. In fact, as we speak, one of our officials had a stroke yesterday and is in hospital. “</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Earlier, the acting EFCC chairman had said most of the problems plaguing Nigeria were caused by corruption.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">He added that even cancer could be traced to corruption.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Magu called on Nigerians to assist the anti-graft agency to tackle corruption, adding that the EFCC could not do it alone.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">He also commended INEC for helping to tackle corruption.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The EFCC boss said, “Everyone must join in the fight against corruption. Corruption is a disaster, it has done too much damage in this country and I believe INEC is fighting corruption indirectly. They may not be fighting corruption the way we are fighting it. That is why I said fight corruption whichever way you want to fight it.”</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Copyright PUNCH.<br />\n</strong>All rights reserved.

officials, Nwosu Christian, and Tijani Bashiru, were picked up on the premises of the Federal High Court in Lagos where they are being prosecuted before Justice Mohammed Idris.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Their re-arrest by the EFCC on Wednesday came shortly after their trial was adjourned by the judge.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">They had barely stepped out of the court when they were picked up by waiting EFCC operatives and whisked away immediately.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">In the charge against them, they were accused of taking a bribe of N264m from a former Minister of Petroleum Resources, Mrs, Diezani Alison-Madueke to compromise the 2015 general elections.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The EFCC said they ought to have known that the funds were proceeds of fraud.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">It said they acted contrary to Sections 15 (3), 16 (2) and 18 (a) of the Money Laundering Prohibition Amendment Act, 2015.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Nwosu  had earlier pleaded guilty to the charges and opted for a plea bargain, after which the EFCC told the court that it had already recovered N5m cash and a landed property worth N25m from him.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">But Nwosu later abandoned the plea bargain after Justice Idris rejected the N500,000 fine proposed for him as punishment by the EFCC.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Justice Idris had held that by virtue of Section 16(2)(b) of the Money Laundering (Prohibition) Act, under which Nwosu was charged, he was supposed to pay a fine of N10m or go to jail for two years.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The judge held, “I have read carefully the plea bargain agreement and I have reviewed the content of same. By Section 270 of the Administration of Criminal Justice Act, a plea bargain agreement is allowed as in this case, wherein the first defendant has provided relevant information to aid the prosecution of this case&#8230;it appears to me that by the above provisions of the ACJA, under a plea bargain agreement, the appropriate sentence to be recommended should be within the appropriate range of punishment stipulated for the offence charged.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">“The first defendant was found guilty of an offence contrary to sections 1(a) and 16(b) of the Money Laundering (Prohibition) Amended Act, 2012 and punishable under Section 16(2)(b) of the same Act.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">“Section 16(2)(b) of the Act provides as follows: A person who commits an offence under subsection 1 paragraph A is liable, on conviction, to imprisonment or a prison term not less than two years or a fine of not less than N10m&#8230;The provisions of Section 16(2)(b) is clear and unambiguous&#8230;It is for the above reason that I find the proposal in paragraph of the plea bargain agreement, filed on 5th April, 2017, inadequate.”</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Copyright PUNCH.<br />\n</strong>All rights reserved.

Those declaratory judgments should be complied with in the absence of any appeal. On the other hand, there are executory judgments. And these are the ones that people often feel frustrated about. And it is because of the length of time it takes the judgment creditor to enforce the judgment. So, there’s apathy, there’s frustration on the part of people. If, for instance, there is a land matter and the judgment is in my favour, it is a Herculean task, enforcing the judgment. Despite that the court has made orders, giving me possession, I have to first submit the judgment at the police station, where one Commissioner of Police or an Assistant Commissioner of Police will sit on the order that the court has already given me. Ordinarily, the order should be enforced within a maximum of seven days, in the absence of any appeal. But by the time the police begin by sending someone from the headquarters to verify the judgment, frustration begins to set in for the judgment creditor.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">A landlord has got judgment against a tenant who has owed five years’ rent, but he cannot enforce the judgment by himself. He has to go through the police, who will now set their own rules and make some unprintable requests. If he doesn’t meet the conditions, the judgment does not get enforced for weeks, months. So, how do you expect that kind of person to react? And this is what I believe we should address.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The solution is to have what we call Court Police Units to be headed by not less than an Assistant Commissioner of Police, who will be subject to the control of the Chief Judge. If the Railway Corporation, the Nigeria Ports Authorities have police units, why should the judiciary not have? With the police unit next door to the CJ, for every order of court, every judgment, he ensures enforcement. The judgment creditor doesn’t have to go to one DPO to seek the enforcement of the order. That Court Police Unit should be manned by an ACP and about nine other policemen to start with. Their job is enforcement of court orders and judgments. Once they are there and there’s a litigant who has an order to take possession of a land and so on, it is the ACP that he would approach. Then people will begin to have confidence in the justice system. You were in court for five, 10 years and you eventually get judgment but you cannot enforce it for three, six months, that is not judgment. Justice delayed is justice denied.  The way out, if it will be permitted, is to ensure that the judiciary itself has its own police unit.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Will this suggestion not conflict with the constitutional provision that vests the control of police in the executive?</strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">No; we are talking about interrelationship among the arms of government. Will a judge sit without being sworn in by the executive? It is an interrelationship that must exist. The beauty of the separation of powers is to be able to have what we call institutions and not individuals.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>How do we get past a situation where the government flagrantly disobeys court orders and citizens are helpless like in the case of Ibrahim El-Zakzaky?</strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">It is really unfortunate that we have found ourselves in such a situation, which should not be. There are processes to be followed. There is no order of court, whether rightly or wrongly made, that should not be obeyed, unless that order is stayed or set aside. Court orders must be complied with by every government. That is how to build and strengthen institutions. It is you today in power; it will be someone else tomorrow. What will you do if you are at the receiving end tomorrow? We must ensure that we develop and protect our institutions.  A court cannot give an order that should be flagrantly disobeyed, no matter how highly placed the person is. It is an abuse of institutions and the consequences will boomerang on all of us. The best thing to do is to also use the law. That is why there is constitutional right of appeal. That, I think, is the way to go round it.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>From your experience in public service, do you think financial autonomy for the judiciary is realistic or should we rather scrap that provision from the constitution, seeing how difficult it has become for most states to comply?</strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">There is nobody that should be against the autonomy of the judicially either financial autonomy or independence in their core responsibility, which is adjudication of disputes; nobody should interfere. For judges to be able to adjudicate properly there must be judicial independence and it is the operation of this that people do not understand. Does the judiciary have enough source of revenue for itself? The answer is ‘No’.  Even the legislature does not have. But there must be transparency in the budget process. Once the budget has been prepared and passed, and we know what is due to the judiciary, same should be released to the head of the court. As of today, I am sure the judiciary has its own vote in the budget but where the problem is is the issue of transparency. I don’t believe that the judiciary should go cap-in-hand to the executive every time to say I need approval for this and that. Once the budget is passed and we know what is budgeted for the judiciary, that percentage of the revenue should go to the head of court who will decide how it should be expended and of course there is an auditor.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">It is a misconception that the executive doesn’t want the judiciary to be independent. I worked in government and I saw it happen and I know that is really not the case. We should push for it and ensure that any hiccup in the arrangement is resolved. And how that can be done is transparency. And that is why we have advocated for there to be court administrators, who know what to do. We have got to the stage when we must have court administrators — people with accounting knowledge —  to present and defend the budget of the judiciary and state what is required by the judiciary. The judiciary is an arm of government, so, any money coming in should be divided into three among the executive, legislature and the judiciary and whatever is due to the judiciary should be released to the judiciary to be expended by the judiciary.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>It is common among old lawyers to complain of falling standards in the profession; do you share this concern or is it mere sentiment?</strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">It is not sentiment, to be honest and it is not limited to the legal profession. It is a reflection of the falling standard of education in the country.  When the foundation is weak, what do you expect to get? We have brilliant young lawyers but how many of them? Some of them, common construction of a letter of demand, they cannot write and you’ll be wondering, ‘which university did this one pass through?’ To me, there is a need to properly review the admission criteria into the law school and it is not a question of some of us have climbed the ladder and want to remove the ladder from those coming behind. We will be injuring ourselves if we fail to act; there will be no more profession for us, if we don’t begin to address it from now. For me, I think the advocacy should be if you don’t have a first degree before coming to study law, go and have HSC or what they call GCE advanced level; you would have been well groomed. We must look at the foundation very well. You finish your school cert, you want to study law, go and do advanced learning, where you do government, economics, history at advanced level. Law itself needs a bit of maturity and I tell you, we used to have lay magistrates in Lagos, before it was abolished. The magistrates didn’t go to any law school but they were adjudicating with their wealth of experience. They were lay magistrates with limited jurisdiction but you see some of them write beautiful judgments. So, it is an advancement we want and people, who want to study law, should have well grounded foundation. Then from there, we should address the law school; to ensure it is more practical.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>In the last two years, it’s been turbulent for the judiciary with the prosecution of some high-ranking lawyers and judges. Are you worried for the judiciary?</strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The first cardinal principle of the law is that nobody is above the law. So, anybody that is found wanting, surely, consequences must follow. The only concern I have is how the entire process is being politicised. Due process must be followed and that is what is lacking.  You have already arraigned the Number 3 citizen, if there is evidence against a judge, why not? We must only ensure that due process is followed. What is the hurry if a judge has truly committed an offence? If the National Judicial Council sits and says give me the evidence you have against this judge and after sitting, it says I can’t find merit in this allegation. Who are in the NJC? Grey-headed wise men Justices and they say we can’t find anything from what you submitted that will justify the criminal prosecution of this judge. But you say the NJC is protecting its own, and then you go and arrest the judge; who are you taking the judge before? Another judge. But it would have carried more weight if the NJC sees the evidence and says we can’t continue to retain this man in the justice system, please ask the person to be dismissed or retired and the anti-graft agency then picks the person up on the same fact; the case is as good as won already. And that is the way I think we should go. But we have politicised the whole thing. In spite of the turbulence, for me, the judiciary has fared well.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Recently, the Chief Justice of Nigeria issued a warning that people should stop commenting on subsisting court cases, and then the Federal Government said it had begun monitoring the social media comments of citizens. Don’t you think there is an attempt by the government to silence the public?</strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">I don’t really think so and I don’t think anybody will want to go through that route. Yes, some of us will not do our cases on the pages of the newspapers but if a journalist is fortunate to be in court and hears the proceedings, he can report. But I won’t go to the press and start canvassing arguments that I am supposed to canvass in court. Let the press do their job.  But arguing cases in the press, outside the courtroom should be discouraged. Whatever the pressmen can take from court proceedings let them report and anybody who reports wrongly will have himself to blame for contempt.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">As to the Federal Government monitoring people’s comment on the social media, I am not seized of that. But how can that be done in the light of the constitution, when citizens have the right of expression, and right to privacy? In other climes, there are certain things that they monitor too for security purpose, but they won’t tell you they are monitoring anything; they know what they are looking for. Now to say someone should be picked up for what he says! Then what should Donald Trump do in America? Jump into the sea? But there should be consequences for reckless statements that are defamatory. There are provisions in our law to deal with that. And it is worrisome how pure civil matters are turned into criminal matters in this country. Anybody that makes reckless statements or spread falsehood could be taken up in court. You must be sure before you start accusing somebody. We should be very cautious about that and what the government should be looking for should be more than this. If government is monitoring banking activities to detect money laundering, or those funding terrorism, there is nothing wrong in that, but not to say someone critising government should be arrested; it is his personal opinion.

Ibrahim Babangida, Mr. Kassim Afegbua, has sued the Nigeria Police Force, the Inspector-General of Police, Mr. Ibrahim Idris, and two media houses, for alleged harassment and persecution over a statement he issued on behalf of his principal considered critical of the administration of President Muhammadu Buhari.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Afegbua, in the suit marked, FHC/ABJ/CS/129/2018, which was filed before the Federal High Court in Abuja on Tuesday, asked for N1bn as damages for the breach of his fundamental human rights.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Those joined as respondents to the suit are the Nigeria Police Force, the IGP, the Force Public Relations Officer, Mr. Moshood Jimoh, the <em>Nigerian Television Authority</em> and the <em>Channels TV.</em></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The IG had, in a statement issued by Jimoh on Monday, ordered the arrest of Afegbua for “making false statements, defamation of character and for an act capable of instigating public disturbance throughout the country.”</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">There was confusion on Sunday over two statements purportedly written by the former military dictator, which bordered on the 2019 elections, herdsmen-farmers’ crisis and other issues plaguing the nation.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">In an earlier statement titled, ‘Towards a National Rebirth,’ and signed by Afegbua, Babangida advised Nigerians to do away with analogue leaders and embrace those of the digital age.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">However, another statement issued hours after the first distanced Babangida from the first statement.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Afegbua had stood by his statement, saying he sat with Babangida before it was issued.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">But the Inspector-General of Police, in a statement by the police spokesman on Monday, declared Afegbua wanted in connection with the statement he issued.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Afegbua, in his suit filed on Tuesday by his lawyer, Dr Kayode Ajulo, argued that he was not formally invited by the police before he was declared wanted and painted “as a fugitive and common criminal with no modicum of dignity.”</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">He described his being declared wanted as a witch-hunt, harassment, intimidation and persecution, saying his principal had not denied the statement he issued on his behalf.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">According to the applicant, the police, the IGP and the Force PPRO used the platforms of the<em> NTA </em>and<em> Channels TV</em> to declare him wanted.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">He sought, as part of his prayers, a declaration that “the continued witch-hunt, harassment, intimidation, and persecution of the applicant or threats thereof by the respondents ostensibly on the basis of a letter he wrote on behalf of his principal, General lbrahim Badamosi Babangida, GCFR, when his principal has not lodged any formal complaint to the police or any other security agency, amounted to the violation of his rights.”</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">He also sought that “the declaration  by the 1st to 3rd respondents through the media of the 4th to 5th respondents that the applicant is wanted when there has been no formal invitation extended to the applicant or any attempt has been made to arrest him and he has resisted or refused to honour such invitation do not only constitute prosecutorial misconduct, malicious process, malfeasance in public office by the 1st to 3rd respondents, but also infringe unjustifiably, illegally and unconstitutionally upon the applicant’s fundamental rights to life, dignity of human person, liberty to be presumed innocent until proven guilty, freedom of expression, association and movement.”</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">He claimed his said rights were “guaranteed and protected respectively by sections 33, 34, 35, 36, 39, 40 and 41 of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, 1999 (as amended) and Articles 2,4,5,6,7,9,1o,11,12 and 13 of the African Charter on Human and Peoples’ Rights (Ratification and Enforcement)Act, Cap. A9, Laws of the Federation of Nigeria, 2004.”</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">In addition, he sought “an order of perpetual injunction, restraining the respondents by themselves, their officers, servants, agents and privies from the continued witch-hunt, harassment, intimidation, and persecution of the applicant or threats thereof ostensibly on the basis of a letter he wrote on behalf of his principal, General Ibrahim Badamosi Babangida, GCFR.”</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">He also sought “an order directing the respondents to stay all actions and to desist forthwith from proceeding with any process whatsoever, including but not limited to any purported investigation, detention, prosecution of the applicant or otherwise, which is connected, associated with or premised upon the letter he wrote on behalf of his principal, General lbrahim Badamosi Babangida, GCFR.”</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">He also sought an order directing the respondents to pay him “severally and jointly the sum of N1,000,000,000 (N1bn) as damages for the breach of the fundamental rights of the applicant.”</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">He also sought “an order directing the respondents to apologise to the applicant through the media of the 4th to the 5th respondents and three national newspapers.”</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">As part of his grounds of the suit, Afegbua described himself as a “renowned journalist, publisher, writer, spokesperson for General Ibrahim Badamosi Babangida, GCFR, and a former commissioner in Edo State.”</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">He said he “wrote a letter on behalf of his principal, General Ibrahim Badamosi Babangida, GCFR on February 4, 2016, which was widely publicised.”</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">He added that there was another letter, “purportedly to have emanated from the applicant’s principal on the evening of the same February 4, 2018.”</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">But he noted that “there has been no formal complaint by the applicant’s principal to the police or any other security agency of any infraction by the applicant.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">“The 1st to 3rd respondents, through the media of the 4th and 5th respondents, declared the applicant wanted and the action of the respondents has put the life of the applicant in serious jeopardy and he now has real trepidation for his life.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">“There was no formal invitation to the applicant from the 1st to 3rd respondents and there was no attempt by the 1st to 3rd respondents to arrest the applicant.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">“The applicant has not refused to honour any formal invitation by the 1st to 3rd respondents and he has not resisted arrest by the applicant, hence there is no basis for declaring the applicant wanted.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">“The 4th to 5th respondents used their media to broadcast to the whole world that the applicant is wanted at the behest of the 1st to 3rd respondents.”</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Nigerians berate IG</strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Prominent groups and Nigerians on Tuesday berated the Inspector-General of Police, Mr. Ibrahim Idris, for declaring Babangida’s spokesman wanted.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">A human rights advocacy group, Socio-Economic Rights and Accountability Project, challenged the legality of the move by the police to arrest Afegbua.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">In a statement on Tuesday by its Deputy Director, Timothy Adewale, SERAP faulted the police on the arrest order.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">SERAP said, “To speak out about political or other public interest issues cannot qualify as making false statements. And it is certainly not defamation of character, let alone an act capable of instigating public disturbance. It is the essence of democracy and human rights.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">“Declaring Afegbua wanted is unwarranted because there is no evidence of inciting violence against him.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">“Declaring him wanted for exercising his right to freedom of expression is the hallmark of an oppressive government.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">“The police should immediately withdraw its unlawful declaration and end the harassment of Afegbua. President Muhammadu Buhari should publicly instruct the police that it’s their duty to facilitate people’s enjoyment of their freedoms, not to hinder them.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"> “At any rate, Babangida is not known to have lodged any complaint to the police on the matter. He reportedly confirmed Afegbua’s statement. Even if Babangida had issues with Afegbua’s statement, it’s not the police’s business to take upon itself Babangida’s perceived cause of action.”</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The opposition Peoples Democratic Party cautioned the police and other security agencies not be used by the All Progressives Congress as instruments for persecuting Nigerians.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The PDP said the move to arrest Afegbua was a ploy to set the agenda for a vicious muzzling of constitutionally-guaranteed free speech.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The PDP National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan, in a statement on Tuesday, said some “recent distasteful events,” including unwarranted harassment of perceived opponents of the APC, showed that the party was jittery.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The opposition party said the APC had   realised that its chances of winning the 2019 general elections had vanished.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">It described the trend as a dangerous threat to the nation’s democracy and symptomatic of a failed party that was prepared to turn against the citizens in a desperate bid to hang onto power against the will of the people.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">It said, “We now have a terrifying situation where people are harassed for daring to aspire for certain elective offices or expressing opinion regarding governance in the country.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">“Nigerians and the international community have seen that almost all those who have openly expressed, or perceived to be nursing ambition for certain offices, including the presidency, are now facing one trumped-up charge or the other, ostensibly meant to cow and discredit them.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">“The APC has refused to wake up to the reality that Nigerians have reached a consensus rejecting it and that no amount of intimidation and persecution with state apparatus of power can make them change that resolve to vote out APC and its candidates come 2019.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">“We therefore call on all well-meaning Nigerians to caution the APC.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">“The fact that the APC is leaving office in 2019 has become inevitable and no one should be part of their desperation to completely ruin our nation before their exit.”</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>IG has defamed Afegbua</strong> –Falana</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">A human rights lawyer, Femi Falana (SAN), said the Inspector-General of Police had defamed Afegbua by declaring him wanted.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Falana, in a statement on Monday said “no criminal offence known to law has been committed to warrant the action of the Inspector-General of Police.”</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The SAN said, “By declaring Mr. Afegbua wanted when he has not failed to honour the invitation of the police, the Inspector-General of Police has overreached himself. It is the Inspector-General of Police who has defamed Mr. Afegbua by portraying him as a fugitive from the law.  Therefore, Mr. Idris is advised to withdraw the offensive declaration without any further delay.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">“Having regard to the facts and circumstances of the issuance of the public statement by Mr. Afegbua and the denial by General Babangida, it ought to be pointed out that no criminal offence known to law has been committed to warrant the action of the Inspector-General of Police. More so, both General Babangida and President Buhari have not complained that the controversial press statement defamed them.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">“In fact, if the statement is considered defamatory, whoever is injured would have to institute a civil suit where he will be required to put his own reputation in issue.”</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Falana said those in public office should not be intolerant of criticisms.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">According to him, where a writer exceeds the bounds, there should be a resort to the law of libel where the plaintiff must of necessity ‘‘put his character and reputation in issue.’’</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>‘We are on a dangerous road to dictatorship’</strong></p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Another lawyer, Mr. Jiti Ogunye, said the nation was on the road to dictatorship.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">He said, “For us, this is not about Afegbua. It is about the dangerous road to civilian dictatorship that our much raped and abused country is, again, taking by the IGP’s attempt to kill rights to freedom of expression.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">“We are not so much interested in what IBB said or what he didn’t say. It is the brightness of the day that brings forth the adder. We are concerned about the role the police are now being allowed to play in our democracy.”</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Afegbua’ll appear before police today</strong> –Lawyer</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Afegbua, will present himself to the police on Wednesday (today), his lawyer, Ajulo, has said.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The lawyer, in a letter to the Inspector-General of Police, Ibrahim Idris, on Tuesday protested that his client was not invited by the police before he was declared wanted on Monday.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">He stated that Afegbua had been “advised of his right and remedies available to him as a law abiding citizen of Nigeria, and he has elected to make himself available to the police on Wednesday once he returns from his trip.”</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">He said, “There are spelt out procedures for declaring a person wanted. The police or other law enforcement agencies can declare a person wanted if they find reasons to do so, particularly if the person is a suspect in the commission of a crime and is on the run.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">“Our client, in discharging his duty to his principal (Babangida) can neither be said to have committed a crime that warrants such negative publicity nor is he on the run.”</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The lawyer stated that the arrest order would be challeged in court.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Copyright PUNCH.</strong><strong><br />\n</strong><em>All rights reserved.
