And as he was taken to hospital for treatment to self-inflicted knife wounds to his foot, he headbutted another officer and had to be sedated by medical staff.</p>\n<p>Paramedics took Mr. Volpe to Kings College Hospital in a critical condition but died three days later despite having a liver transplant.</p>\n<p>Foy admitted manslaughter, claiming a lack of intent, but denied murder. He was convicted of murder at the Old Bailey on Monday, and jailed for life with a minimum of 17 years.</p>\n<p>In the days before the attack Foy, who suffers depression, had not taken his medication, and chose to self-medicate with cocaine and alcohol instead, the judge said.</p>\n<p>He had drunk five pints of lager, a litre of Jack Daniels whiskey and rum, and taken up to four-and-a-half grams of cocaine before leaving the house at 6.45pm.</p>\n<p>Judge Sarah Munro QC said: &#8220;You took with you a large kitchen knife, going back and forward across the road to gouge your foot, believing there was a bomb.</p>\n<p>&#8220;You had spent the previous evening, night and morning of the 11th of August filling yourself with alcohol and cocaine.</p>\n<p>&#8220;You took all that, knowing the combination could make you angry, paranoid, aggressive and violent.</p>\n<p>&#8220;You have a longstanding history of drink and drug abuse.

Both men were reportedly injured.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The next day, Olaleye’s health condition deteriorated and he was rushed to a private hospital where he was confirmed dead.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The deceased’s family members were said to have reported the case at the Ibafo Police Station.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>PUNCH Metro</em> learnt that neighbours, who got wind of a possible mass arrest, fled the house.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">When our correspondent visited the community on Thursday, he observed that the house had been locked up.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Residents approached  for information either declined comment or feigned ignorance of the incident.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">However, <em>PUNCH Metro</em> established contact with a few of the runaway tenants, who spoke on condition of anonymity.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">A father of two said the police locked up the house when they did not meet anyone, adding that they left with three generators belonging to tenants.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">He said, “I remember the two men had a disagreement over payment for a burnt electrical fuse which was valued at N600. We are 10 tenants in the house occupying the 10 single room apartments. We divided the money and everybody was asked to pay N60.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">“I was sleeping when I heard a noise. I was indisposed and couldn’t go out. But I learnt there was a fight between <em>Alfa</em> and <em>Messiah</em> over the fuse money. Within a few minutes, it was over and everybody dispersed.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">“By morning, the man woke up, took his bath, drew water from the well, and prepared a meal which he ate. But around 12 noon, we observed that his door was ajar. I heard heavy breathing and rallied other tenants to get him to a hospital.”</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Another tenant said no one knew the victim was ill until a family member visited him.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">He noted that the relative raised the alarm, blaming the neighbours for being uncaring.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">He said, “After we settled the dispute between him and <em>Alfa</em>, everybody left for their apartments. They were both OK. <em>Messiah</em> was a painter and he rarely went out. We all saw him do his chores that morning; nobody suspected anything until someone said he was breathing abnormally. A relative who visited him around 12 noon queried us for not checking up on him.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">“We didn’t get a vehicle on time to convey him to a hospital. We later got one. The medical workers did not allow us to take him down from the vehicle before they said he was dead. Inasmuch as I find it difficult to connect his death to the fight, some people said he might have had internal bleeding.”</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>PUNCH Metro</em> gathered that the news of the death sent fear into the community, as many residents took to their heels.  The prime suspect, Raheem, who had gone to work, reportedly did not return to the house.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">A female tenant said later that evening, the police arrived in the community in a bus.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">“They broke <em>Alfa</em>’s apartment and took some things away. They also locked up the entire house after carrying away three generators. As I speak to you, most of the tenants are squatting with friends and family members. We have nowhere to go,” she said.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">A senior police officer from the Ibafo division said it was a murder case, adding that it had been transferred to the State Criminal Investigation and Intelligence Department, Eleweran, Abeokuta.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">He urged the victim’s neighbours  to come forward and assist the police with information.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">“The suspect hit the man with a stick and he died. It is a murder case,” he added.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The state Police Public Relations Officer, Abimbola Oyeyemi, confirmed the incident.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">He said, “There was a fight between the two tenants on Monday and in the process, one of them died. All the tenants in the house fled; nobody reported to the police. It was when the victim’s relatives arrived from Lagos that they met his corpse in the house. That was how the police knew about it.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">“When we got there, we didn’t see anybody; the house was deserted. The police found two generators on the corridor and because it was not safe to leave them there, they decided to secure them by taking them to the station. We have not seen any of the tenants since then. The state Commissioner of Police, Ahmad Iliyasu, has ordered that the suspect be made to face the full wrath of the law.”</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">”<strong>Copyright PUNCH.</strong><strong><br />\n</strong><em>All rights reserved.

preservation of endangered species entails that Customs administrations globally protect wildlife by intercepting illegal trade on such animals.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">   “It further prevents the killings of endangered species since the tusks are only available after the killing of the elephant or pangolin.”</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">   He said the items would be handed

I witnessed the torture of the girl (Vera) by her stepmother. She beat her for about three hours on that day. I was sad and informed the community development association chairman who advised that that we should report the case to the police.”</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Vera said she had returned from her school – some distance away from the house – on the day with Favour, but returned to the school premises to play.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">She said when she returned home around 3.30pm, she met her stepmother, who beat her up with a stick for playing on the street.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The girl added that Nnachi put a knife in a burning liquefied petroleum gas (cooking gas) for some minutes and pressed it on her back.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">She said, “On Wednesday, February 7, after the school closed, I went back to the school compound to play and came back home around 3.30pm. When my stepmother returned from her shop in Isheri Osun, she asked me why I left home to play on the street. I told her that I was playing at the school compound, but she said I was lying.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">“She started beating me. She put on the cooking gas and placed a knife on fire. She put pepper in my eyes and I could not see again. She then pressed the hot knife on my back. I cried and felt pains.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">“The following day, my younger sister woke up in the morning with faeces on her body. She (Nnachi) beat her and put pepper in her eyes too. Our father had travelled when the incidents happened.”</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The suspect, the mother of one, in her statement to the police reportedly confessed to assaulting Vera, adding that she did not treat her injuries.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">She said, “Favour and Vera have been living with me since 2014 when I got married to their father. I was told their mother died in 2012 after Favour’s birth. On February 7 around 3pm, I came back from my shop in Isheri Osun and met only Favour and my two-year-old child, Dominion, at home.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">“I checked everywhere, but did not see Vera. When she later came back, I asked her where she went to. She said she went to another street. As I wanted to beat her, she ran away. Her school proprietress brought her home. When the proprietress left, I put fresh pepper in her eyes and pressed a hot knife on her back several times. Vera was the one who took care of her sister and my son when I had gone to the shop.”</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">A police prosecutor, Sergeant Koti Aondohemba, brought the defendant before an Ogba Magistrate’s Court on Tuesday on five counts of assault.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"> Aondohemba told the court that the offences contravened sections 10(b)(c)(d) of the Child Rights Law of Lagos State of Nigeria, 2015.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The charges read in part, “That you, Chidima Nnachi, on February 7, 2018 around 3.30pm, on Aso Rock Street, Brucknor Estate, Ejigbo, Lagos, in the Lagos Magisterial District, did inflict injuries on one Vera, 10 years old, by burning her back with a hot kitchen knife and caused her bodily harm.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">“That you, Chidima Nnachi, did unlawfully assault one Favour, five years old, by flogging her all over her body and inflicting injuries on her back and face, thereby committing an offence punishable under Section 10(c) of the Child Rights Law of Lagos State of Nigeria, 2015.”</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The defendant, however, pleaded not guilty to the charges and elected summary trial.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The presiding magistrate, Mr. A.O.

He was uncertain about the exact number of people injured, but at least 14 were taken to hospital and two had died there of their wounds.</p>\n<p>The shooting, one of nearly 20 since the start of the year, will once again throw the spotlight on the epidemic of gun violence in the United States and the ready accessibility of weapons in a country with 33,000 gun-related deaths annually.</p>\n<p>&#8220;This is a terrible day for Parkland,&#8221; Israel said, speaking of the city of about 30,000 people, located 50 miles (80 kilometers) north of Miami.</p>\n<p>&#8220;My very own triplets went to that school.&#8221;</p>\n<p>A teacher at the school told The Miami Herald that Cruz had been identified previously as a potential threat to his classmates.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We were told last year that he wasn&#8217;t allowed on campus with a backpack on him,&#8221; math teacher Jim Gard said. &#8220;There were problems with him last year threatening students, and I guess he was asked to leave campus.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Cruz was also said to have been in the Junior ROTC (Reserve Officers&#8217; Training Corps) program while at school.</p>\n<p>A law enforcement source told CBS News that the gunman pulled a fire alarm before opening fire, but Israel said he could not confirm that report.</p>\n<h2>&#8211; &#8216;Everyone started running&#8217; &#8211;</h2>\n<p>Parkland Mayor Christine Hunschofsky told CNN she had spoken to a number of students after the shooting erupted shortly after 2:00 pm (1900 GMT).</p>\n<p>&#8220;They were very scared,&#8221; she said. &#8220;And almost in shock when they came out.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Television images showed students, some with their hands in the air, being led out of the school by heavily armed police officers and an armored vehicle filled with a SWAT team on the scene.</p>\n<p>Student Jeiella Dodoo told CBS News that she and her schoolmates had evacuated their classroom calmly after hearing what they thought had been a routine fire alarm.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The alarm went off so we had to evacuate from our classes,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Then we heard gunshots.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I heard about six gunshots,&#8221; she said, &#8220;and then some people started running and then everyone started running because we were like &#8216;If it&#8217;s real, then just run.\'&#8221;</p>\n<p>Teacher Melissa Falkowski told US networks that she had helped 19 students squeeze into a closet with her.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We were in there for probably 40 minutes. We were locked in the closet until SWAT came and got us,&#8221; she told CNN.</p>\n<p>Police officers in helmets, bulletproof vests and armed with automatic weapons could be seen stationed at several points around the sprawling school complex, which serves nearly 3,000 students.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Just a horrible day for us,&#8221; said the superintendent of the county&#8217;s school district, Robert Runcie.</p>\n<p>&#8220;This is very sad to me and our family too,&#8221; 61-year-old Joseph Panikulangara, whose 17-year-old niece Dhiya attends the school, told AFP.</p>\n<p>The FBI said it was assisting local law enforcement with the investigation.</p>\n<p>When asked about security, Hunschofsky said a police officer is always stationed at the school and there was a &#8220;single point of entry.&#8221;</p>\n<h2>&#8211; No child should &#8216;feel unsafe&#8217; &#8211;</h2>\n<p>President Donald Trump offered his &#8220;prayers and condolences to the families of the victims.</p>\n<p>&#8220;No child, teacher or anyone else should ever feel unsafe in an American school,&#8221; he said on Twitter.</p>\n<p>Since the December 2012 massacre at the Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, where 20 children and six adults were shot dead, warning procedures and emergency drills have multiplied at US schools.</p>\n<p>But since January 2013, there have been at least 291 school shootings across the country &#8212; an average of about one a week, according to Everytown for Gun Safety, a non-profit group that advocates for gun control.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It is pretty clear that we&#8217;re failing our kids here,&#8221; said Falkowski, the teacher who helped shield her students from harm in a closet.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not saying the solution is one thing or another, but this does not happen in other countries the way it happens here.&#8221;</p>\n<p>AFP.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n'},excerpt:{rendered:"<p>A former student armed with an AR-15 rifle opened fire at a Florida high school on Wednesday, killing at least 17 people, officials said, in a harrowing shooting spree that saw terrified students hiding in closets and under desks as they texted for help.

police in Katsina State have launched an investigation into the circumstances surrounding the death of the wife of a member of the state House of Assembly, Binta Safiyanu, who died after allegedly drinking a herbal concoction to boost the flow of her breast milk.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The deceased, a mother of six, was said to have died a week after being delivered of a set of twins.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"> Northern City News learnt that Binta was said the first wife of Yunusa Jikamshi, the lawmaker representing Musawa constituency in the state House of Assembly.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">It was learnt that after being delivered of the babies, her breast milk was not flowing as expected, a development which made her co-wives to persuade her to drink the concoction.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"> The other two wives allegedly assured her that the concoction would enhance the flow of the milk.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Another version, however, had it that the deceased was fond of taking traditional herbs and allegedly directed a woman identified simply as Sakina to prepare the concoction for her.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"> The deceased reportedly started vomiting shortly after taking the herbal drink.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">She was subsequently rushed to Musawa General Hospital, where she was confirmed dead.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">She has since been buried, according to Islamic rites.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Sources added the incident was initially reported at the Musawa police station from where it was transferred to the state criminal investigation, Katsina bureau, for further investigation.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Sakina is however being detained by the police.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"> The spokesman for the state police command, DSP Isah Gambo, confirmed the incident, adding that investigation was in progress to unravel the real circumstances surrounding Bintu’s death.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The lawmaker could not be reached for comment as he was said to be out of Katsina at the time of filing this report.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Copyright PUNCH.</em><br />\n</strong>All rights reserved.

But the origins of this festival of candy and cupids are actually dark, bloody — and a bit muddled.</p>\n<p>Though no one has pinpointed the exact origin of the holiday, one good place to start is ancient Rome, where men hit on women by, well, hitting them.</p>\n<p>From February 13 to 15, the Romans celebrated the feast of Lupercalia. The men sacrificed a goat and a dog, then whipped women with the hides of the animals they had just slain.</p>\n<p>The Roman romantics &#8220;were drunk. They were naked,&#8221; says Noel Lenski, a historian at the University of Colorado at Boulder. Young women would actually line up for the men to hit them, Lenski says.</p>\n<p>They believed this would make them fertile.</p>\n<p>The brutal fete included a matchmaking lottery, in which young men drew the names of women from a jar. The couple would then be, um, coupled up for the duration of the festival — or longer, if the match was right.</p>\n<p>The ancient Romans may also be responsible for the name of our modern day of love. Emperor Claudius II executed two men — both named Valentine — on February 14 of different years in the 3rd century A.D. Their martyrdom was honored by the Catholic Church with the celebration of St. Valentine&#8217;s Day.</p>\n<p>Later, Pope Gelasius I muddled things in the Fifth Century by combining St. Valentine&#8217;s Day with Lupercalia to expel the pagan rituals. But the festival was more of a theatrical interpretation of what it had once been.</p>\n<p>Lenski adds, &#8220;It was a little more of a drunken revel, but the Christians put clothes back on it. That didn&#8217;t stop it from being a day of fertility and love.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Around the same time, the Normans celebrated Galatin&#8217;s Day. Galatin meant &#8220;lover of women.&#8221; That was likely confused with St. Valentine&#8217;s Day at some point, in part because they sound alike.</p>\n<p>As the years went on, the holiday grew sweeter. Chaucer and Shakespeare romanticized it in their work, and it gained popularity throughout Britain and the rest of Europe. Handmade paper cards became the tokens-du-jour in the Middle Ages.</p>\n<p>Eventually, the tradition made its way to the New World. The industrial revolution ushered in factory-made cards in the 19th century.</p>\n<p>And in 1913, Hallmark Cards of Kansas City, Missouri, began mass producing valentines. February has not been the same since.</p>\n<p>Today, the holiday is big business: According to market research firm IBIS World, Valentine&#8217;s Day sales reached $17.6bn last year; this year&#8217;s sales are expected to total $18.6bn.</p>\n<p>But that commercialization has spoiled the day for many. Helen Fisher, a sociologist at Rutgers University, says we have only ourselves to blame.</p>\n<p>&#8220;This isn&#8217;t a command performance,&#8221; she says. &#8220;If people didn&#8217;t want to buy Hallmark cards, they would not be bought, and Hallmark would go out of business.&#8221;</p>\n<p>And so the celebration of Valentine&#8217;s Day goes on, in varied ways. Many will break the bank buying jewelry and flowers for their beloveds.</p>\n<p>Others will celebrate in a SAD (that&#8217;s Single Awareness Day) way, dining alone and bingeing on self-gifted chocolates.</p>\n<p>A few may even be spending this day the same way the early Romans did. But let&#8217;s not go there.</p>\n<p><em>(National Public Radio)</em></p>\n"},excerpt:{rendered:"<p>Valentine&#8217;s Day is a time to celebrate romance and love and kissy-face fealty.

They were caught with machete and change-over switches. They tied the security guard when they entered the compound.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">“It was already dawn; so, people raised the alarm and the police intervened swiftly. One of them, identified as Jibril, escaped. We are still investigating the matter,” he said.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">But reacting swiftly to the claims of the police, the suspects said they were not robbers, but were on revenge mission to deal with the medical doctor whom they alleged had sexually assaulted them several times.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Williams said they had gone to attack the medical doctor (name withheld) for sexually harassing him and several others.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">“This is the first time I got involved in this kind of thing. I know the medical doctor. He has sexually harassed me a couple of times. I have stopped practising homosexuality, but he kept harassing me. He had his way; so, I had to stay away from him because I knew what he stood for.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">“We did not really go there as armed robbers. We had wanted to teach him a bitter lesson. I feel justified for what I had gone there to do. Although I regret this move now that I was caught,” he said.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Ita said, “I am not into robbery. I was caught because I made some wrong moves. It is the first time I would be making this wrong move. I never expected that the outcome would be this way that was why I took part in it.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">“I had worked for this medical doctor for a while; we worked for him. He has been maltreating his boys. The last time we brought some boys to him, he maltreated them. He kept harassing them with sex.</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;">“He has done it to so many others. The same doctor has done the same thing to us. So, our move was to punish him for what he paid for.”</p>\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Copyright PUNCH.</em><br />\n</strong>All rights reserved.
